# `mscl_survival` #

This repository contains all Python code, Jupyter Notebooks, small data files, and the full text for the publication "Connecting the dots between mechanosensitive channel abundance, osmotic shock, and survival at single-cell resolution."  We encourage the scientific community to fork this repository and open constructive issues that will improve and/or correct any writing in this work. The general architecture of the repository is described below. 


## `code` ## 

This repository contains all processing, analysis, and figure code used in this work. Within `code`, there five subfolders separated by document type. 

1. **`analysis`**: Contains Python scripts (`.py`) that conduct the major analysis described in the work. This includes all Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses. 

2. **`figs`**: Contains Python scripts (`.py`) used to generate the main text and supplementary information figures. 
3. **`notebooks`**: Contains a Jupyter notebook that walks through the image analysis pipeline. 
4. **`processing`**: Contains all experimental processing. Each folder within `processing` is separated by date, strain, and shock rate. Each folder contains a Python script `.py` that performs all image processing and saves a `.csv` for that experimental run. 
5. **`stan`**: All `.stan` models which were used in the MCMC. 

## `data/csv` ##

This folder contains a variety of `.csv` files generated from the MCMC analysis. The primary file, `.mscl_survival_stats.csv`, contains all measurements that were used in the formal analysis.

## `doc` ##

Herein lies the main text of the paper. It was written in MarkDown syntax (`.md`) and converted to LaTex, PDF, and HTML through [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). The file, `make.py` builds the entire paper using information provided in `headers/build_main.yaml`.

## `figs` ##

This folder contains a select number of the figures generated in this work. 

## `mscl` ##

This is a Python module which contains all invariant functions used for processing, analysis, and plotting. It is structured as a typical Python module that can be imported. There are several components to this module, described below. 

1. **`image.py`**: Contains functions related to the loading, manipulation, and processing of the raw microscopy images and parsing the `.xml` files produced through manual identification of survivors and fatalities.

2. **`mcmc.py`**: A set of functions that manipulate the output from `pystan` sampling.

3.**`plotting.py`**: Functions for generating standard plots and setting the plotting style.

5.**`stats.py`**: A set of functions that compute numerous frequently used statistics.
