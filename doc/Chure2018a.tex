\subsection{Abstract}\label{abstract}

Rapid
changes
in
extracellular
osmolarity
are
one of
many
insults
microbial
cells
face
on a
daily
basis.
To
protect
against
such
shocks,
\emph{Escherichia
coli}
and
other
microbes
express
several
types
of
transmembrane
channels
which
open
and
close
in
response
to
changes
in
membrane
tension.
In
\emph{E.
coli},
one of
the
most
abundant
channels
is the
mechanosensitive
channel
of
large
conductance
(MscL).
While
this
channel
has
been
heavily
characterized
through
structural
methods,
electrophysiology,
and
theoretical
modeling,
our
understanding
of its
physiological
role
in
preventing
cell
death
by
alleviating
high
membrane
tension
remains
tenuous.
In
this
work,
we
examine
the
contribution
of
MscL
alone
to
cell
survival
after
osmotic
shock
at
single
cell
resolution
using
quantitative
fluorescence
microscopy.
We
conduct
these
experiments
in an
\emph{E.
coli}
strain
which
is
lacking
all
mechanosensitive
channel
genes
save
for
MscL
whose
expression
is
tuned
across
three
orders
of
magnitude
through
modifications
of the
Shine-Dalgarno
sequence.
While
theoretical
models
suggest
that
only a
few
MscL
channels
would
be
needed
to
alleviate
even
large
changes
in
osmotic
pressure,
we
find
that
between
500
and
700
channels
per
cell
are
needed
to
convey
upwards
of
80\%
survival.
This
number
agrees
with
the
average
MscL
copy
number
measured
in
wild-type
\emph{E.
coli}
cells
through
proteomic
studies
and
quantitative
Western
blotting.
Furthermore,
we
observe
zero
survival
events
in
cells
with
less
than
<<<<<<< HEAD
\textasciitilde{}100
=======
100
>>>>>>> a7f1f48764c67f8af548b5f30711258794088eba
channels
per
cell.
This
work
opens
new
questions
concerning
the
contribution
of
other
mechanosensitive
channels
to
survival
as
well
as
regulation
of
their
activity.

\subsection{Importance}\label{importance}

Mechanosensitive
(MS)
channels
are
transmembrane
protein
complexes
which
open
and
close
in
response
to
changes
in
membrane
tension
as a
result
of
osmotic
shock.
Despite
extensive
biophysical
characterization,
the
contribution
of
these
channels
to
cell
survival
remains
largely
unknown.
In
this
work,
we use
quantitative
video
microscopy
to
measure
the
abundance
of a
single
species
of MS
channel
in
single
cells
followed
by
their
survival
after
a
large
osmotic
shock.
We
observe
total
death
of the
population
with
less
than
<<<<<<< HEAD
\textasciitilde{}100
=======
100
>>>>>>> a7f1f48764c67f8af548b5f30711258794088eba
channels
per
cell
and
determine
that
approximately
500 -
700
channels
are
needed
for
80\%
survival.
The
number
of
channels
we
find
to
confer
nearly
full
survival
is
consistent
with
the
counts
of the
number
of
channels
in
wild
type
cells
in
several
earlier
studies.
These
results
prompt
further
studies
to
dissect
the
contribution
of
other
channel
species
to
survival.

\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}

~~~~
Changes
in the
extracellular
osmolarity
can be
a
fatal
event
for
the
bacterial
cell.
Upon a
hypo-osmotic
shock,
water
rushes
into
the
cell
across
the
membrane,
leaving
the
cell
with
no
choice
but to
equalize
the
pressure.
This
equalization
occurs
either
through
damage
to the
cell
membrane
(resulting
in
death)
or
through
the
regulated
flux
of
water
molecules
through
transmembrane
protein
channels
(Fig
1A).
Such
proteinaceous
pressure
release
valves
have
been
found
across
all
domains
of
life,
with
the
first
bacterial
channel
being
described
in
1987
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-martinac1987}{1}).
Over
the
past
thirty
years,
several
more
channels
have
been
discovered,
described,
and
(in
many
cases)
biophysically
characterized.
\emph{E.
coli},
for
example,
has
seven
of
these
channels
(one
MscL
and
six
MscS
homologs)
which
have
varied
conductance,
gating
mechanisms,
and
expression
levels.
While
they
have
been
the
subject
of
much
experimental
and
theoretical
dissection,
much
remains
a
mystery
with
regard
to the
roles
their
abundance
and
interaction
with
other
cellular
processes
play
in the
greater
context
of
physiology
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-bavi2016}{2}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-vandenberg2016}{8}).

~~ ~
~Of
the
seven
channels
in
\emph{E.
coli},
the
mechanosensitive
channel
of
large
conductance
(MscL)
is one
of the
most
abundant
and
the
best
characterized.
This
channel
has a
large
conductance
(3 nS)
and
mediates
the
flux
of
water
molecules
across
the
membrane
via a
\textasciitilde{}3
nm
wide
pore
in the
open
state
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-cruickshank1997}{9},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-haswell2011}{10}).
Molecular
dynamics
simulations
indicate
that a
single
open
MscL
channel
permits
the
flux
of
\(4 \times 10^9\)
water
molecules
per
second,
which
is an
order
of
magnitude
larger
than a
single
aquaporin
channel
(BNID
100479)
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-louhivuori2010}{11},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-milo2010}{12}).
This
suggests
that
having
only a
few
channels
per
cell
could
be
sufficient
to
relieve
even
large
changes
in
membrane
tension.
Electrophysiological
experiments
have
suggested
a
small
number
of
channels
per
cell
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-booth2005}{13},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-hase1997}{14}),
however,
more
recent
approaches
using
quantitative
<<<<<<< HEAD
Western
=======
western
>>>>>>> a7f1f48764c67f8af548b5f30711258794088eba
blotting,
fluorescence
microscopy,
and
proteomics
have
measured
several
hundred
MscL
per
cell
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-bialecka-fornal2012}{3},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-schmidt2016}{15},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-soufi2015}{16}).
To
further
complicate
matters,
the
expression
profile
of
MscL
appears
to
depend
on
growth
phase,
available
carbon
source,
and
other
environmental
challenges
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-bialecka-fornal2012}{3},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-soufi2015}{16},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-stokes2003a}{17}).
While
there
are
likely
more
than
just a
few
channels
per
cell,
why
cells
seem
to
need
so
many
and
the
biological
rationale
behind
their
condition-dependent
expression
both
remain
a
mystery.

~~~ ~
While
their
biochemical
and
biophysical
characteristics
have
received
much
attention,
their
connection
to
cell
survival
is
understudied.
Drawing
such a
direct
connection
between
channel
copy
number
and
survival
requires
quantitative
\emph{in
vivo}
experiments.
To our
knowledge,
the
work
presented
in van
den
Berg
et al.
2016
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-vandenberg2016}{8})
is the
first
attempt
to
simultaneously
measure
channel
abundance
and
survivability
for a
single
species
of
mechanosensitive
channel.
While
the
measurement
of
channel
copy
number
was
performed
at the
level
of
single
cells
using
super-resolution
microscopy,
survivability
after
a
hypo-osmotic
shock
was
assessed
in
bulk
plating
assays
which
rely
on
serial
dilutions
of a
shocked
culture
followed
by
counting
the
number
of
resulting
colonies
after
incubation.
Such
bulk
assays
have
long
been
the
standard
for
querying
cell
viability
after
an
osmotic
challenge.
While
they
have
been
highly
informative,
they
reflect
only
the
mean
survival
rate
of the
population,
obfuscating
the
variability
in
survival
of the
population.
The
stochastic
nature
of
gene
expression
results
in a
noisy
distribution
of
MscL
channels
rather
than a
single
value,
meaning
those
found
in the
long
tails
of the
distribution
have
quite
different
survival
rates
than
the
mean
but
are
lost
in the
final
calculation
of
survival
probability.

~ ~ ~
~In
this
work,
we
present
an
experimental
system
to
quantitatively
probe
the
interplay
between
MscL
copy
number
and
survival
at
single-cell
resolution,
as is
seen
in
Fig.~\ref{fig:overview}B.
We
generated
an
\emph{E.
coli}
strain
in
which
all
seven
mechanosensitive
channels
had
been
deleted
from
the
chromosome
followed
by a
chromosomal
integration
of a
single
gene
encoding
an
MscL-super-folder
GFP
(sfGFP)
fusion
protein.
To
explore
copy
number
regimes
beyond
those
of the
wild-type
expression
level,
we
modified
the
Shine-Dalgarno
sequence
of
this
integrated
<<<<<<< HEAD
construct,
=======
construct
>>>>>>> a7f1f48764c67f8af548b5f30711258794088eba
allowing
us to
cover
nearly
three
decades
of
MscL
copy
number.
To
probe
survivability,
we
exposed
cells
to a
large
hypo-osmotic
shock
at
controlled
rates
in a
flow
cell
under
a
microscope,
allowing
the
observation
of the
single-cell
channel
copy
number
and
the
resulting
survivability
of
single
cells.
With
this
large
set of
single
cell
measurements,
we
approach
the
calculation
of
survival
probability
in a
manner
that
is
free
of
binning
bias
which
allows
the
reasonable
extrapolation
of
survival
probability
to
copy
numbers
outside
of the
observed
range.
In
addition,
we
show
that
several
hundred
channels
are
needed
to
convey
high
rates
of
survival
and
observe
a
minimum
number
of
channels
needed
to
permit
any
degree
of
survival.

(A) A

As a
result,

rushes

to
equalize
this

increasing
the

the

~~~~To
modulate
the

we
developed
a
series
of
mutants

were
designed

expression
relative
to

These
changes
involved
direct
alterations
of the

sequence

as the
inclusion
of AT

This

been
observed
when
altering
the
abundance
of
several
species
of
mechanosensitive

suggesting
that
they
play
an

As
these

can
vary
widely

shape,
calculating
the
number
of
channels
per
cell
becomes
a more
nuanced
endeavor.
For
example,
taking

could
skew
the

~~~~Due
to the
extensive
overlap
in
expression
between
the
different
Shine-Dalgarno
mutants
(see
Fig.~\ref{fig:boxplot}B),
computing
the
survival
probability
by
treating
each
mutant
as an
individual
bin
obfuscates
the
relationship
between
channel
abundance
and
survival.
To
more
thoroughly
examine
this
relationship,
all
measurements
were
pooled
together
with
each
cell
being
treated
as an
individual
experiment.
The
hypo-osmotic
shock
applied
in
these
experiments
was
varied
across
a
range
of
0.02
Hz
(complete
exchange
in 50
s) to
2.2 Hz
(complete
exchange
in
0.45
s).
Rather
than
pooling
this
wide
range
of
shock
rates
into a
single
data
set,
we
chose
to
separate
the
data
into
``slow
shock''
(
\textless{}
1.0
Hz)
and
``fast
shock''
(\(\geq 1.0\)
Hz)
classes.
Other
groupings
of
shock
rate
were
explored
and
are
discussed
<<<<<<< HEAD
in
Supplement

in the
supplemental

The
cumulative
distributions
of
channel
copy
number
separated
by
survival
are
shown
in
Fig.~\ref{fig:survival_dists}.
In
these
experiments,
survival
was
never
observed
for a
cell
containing
less
than
approximately
100
channels
per
cell,
indicated
by the
red
stripe
in
Fig.~\ref{fig:survival_dists}.
This
suggests
that
there
is a
minimum
number
of
channels
needed
for
survival
on the
order
of 100
per
cell.
We
also
observe
a
slight
shift
in the
surviving
fraction
of the
cells
towards
higher
effective
copy
number,
which
matches
our
intuition
that
including
more
mechanosensitive
channels
increases
the
survival
probability.

\subsubsection{Prediction
of
survival
probability
as a
function
of
channel
copy
number}\label{prediction-of-survival-probability-as-a-function-of-channel-copy-number}

~~~~There
are
several
ways
by
which
the
survival
probability
can be
calculated.
The
most
obvious
approach
would
be to
group
each
individual
Shine-Dalgarno
mutant
as a
single
bin
and
compute
the
average
MscL
copy
number
and
the
survival
probability.
Binning
by
strain
is the
most
frequently
used
approach
for
such
measurements
and
has
provided
valuable
insight
into
the
qualitative
relationship
of
survival
on
other
physiological
factors
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-bialecka-fornal2015}{4},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-vandenberg2016}{8}).
However
the
copy
number
distribution
for
each
Shine-Dalgarno
mutant
(Fig.~\ref{fig:boxplot}B)
is
remarkably
wide
and
overlaps
with
the
other
strains.
We
argue
that
this
coarse-grained
binning
negates
the
benefits
of
performing
single-cell
measurements
as two
strains
with
different
means
but
overlapping
quartiles
would
be
treated
as
distinctly
different
distributions.

~~~~Another
approach
would
be to
pool
all
data
together,
irrespective
of the
Shine-Dalgarno
mutation,
and
bin by
a
defined
range
of
channels.
Depending
on the
width
of the
bin,
this
could
allow
for
finer
resolution
of the
quantitative
trend,
but
the
choice
of the
bin
width
is
arbitrary
with
the
\emph{a
priori}
knowledge
that
is
available.
Drawing
a
narrow
bin
width
can
easily
restrict
the
number
of
observed
events
to
small
numbers
where
the
statistical
precision
of the
survival
probability
is
lost.
On the
other
hand,
drawing
wide
bins
increases
the
precision
of the
estimate,
but
becomes
further
removed
from a
true
single-cell
measurement
and
represents
a
population
mean,
even
though
it may
be a
smaller
population
than
binning
by the
Shine-Dalgarno
sequence
alone.
In
both
of
these
approaches,
it is
difficult
to
extrapolate
the
quantitative
trend
outside
of the
experimentally
observed
region
of
channel
copy
number.
Here,
we
present
a
method
to
estimate
the
probability
of
survival
for
any
channel
copy
number,
even
those
that
lie
outside
of the
experimentally
queried
range.

~~~~To
quantify
the
survival
probability
while
maintaining
single-cell
resolution,
we
chose
to use
a
logistic
regression
model
which
does
not
require
grouping
data
into
arbitrary
bins
and
treats
each
cell
measurement
as an
independent
experiment.
Logistic
regression
is an
inferential
method
to
model
the
probability
of a
<<<<<<< HEAD
Boolean
=======
boolean
>>>>>>> a7f1f48764c67f8af548b5f30711258794088eba
or
categorical
event
(such
as
survival
or
death)
given
one or
several
predictor
variables
and is
commonly
used
in
medical
statistics
to
compute
survival
rates
and
dose
response
curves
<<<<<<< HEAD
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-anderson2003}{21},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-mishra2016}{22}).

\protect\hyperlink{ref-mishra2016}{23}).
>>>>>>> a7f1f48764c67f8af548b5f30711258794088eba
The
primary
assumption
of
logistic
regression
is
that
the
log-odds
probability
of
survival
\(p_{s}\)
is
linearly
dependent
on the
predictor
variable,
in our
case
the
log
channels
per
cell
\(N_{c}\)
with a
dimensionless
intercept
\(\beta_0\)
and
slope
\(\beta_1\),
\begin{equation}
\log{p_s \over 1 - p_s} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \log N_c.
\label{eq:linear_channel_logit}\end{equation}
Under
this
assumption
of
linearity,
\(\beta_0\)
is the
log-odds
probability
of
survival
with
no
MscL
channels.
The
slope
\(\beta_1\)
represents
the
change
in the
log-odds
probability
of
survival
conveyed
by a
single
channel.
As the
calculated
number
of
channels
in
this
work
spans
nearly
three
orders
of
magnitude,
it is
better
to
perform
this
regression
on
\(\log N_c\)
as
regressing
on
\(N_c\)
directly
would
give
undue
weight
for
lower
channel
copy
numbers
due to
the
sparse
sampling
of
high-copy
number
cells.
The
functional
form
shown
in
Eq.~\ref{eq:linear_channel_logit}
can be
derived
directly
from
Bayes'
theorem
and is
shown
<<<<<<< HEAD
in
Supplement
E. If

information
(\emph{Logistic
Regression}).
If one
>>>>>>> a7f1f48764c67f8af548b5f30711258794088eba
knows
the
values
of
\(\beta_0\)
and
\(\beta_1\),
the
survival
probability
can be
expressed
as
\begin{equation}
p_s = \frac{1}{1 + N_c^{-\beta_1}e^{-\beta_0}}.
\label{eq:prob}\end{equation}
In

~~~~
The
results
of the
logistic
regression
are
shown
in
Fig.~\ref{fig:survival}.
We see
a
slight
rightward
shift
the
survival
probability
curve
under
fast
shock
relative
to the
slow
shock
case,
reaffirming
the
conclusion
that
survival
is
also
dependent
on the
rate
of
osmotic
shock
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-bialecka-fornal2015}{4}).
This
rate
dependence
has
been
observed
for
cells
expressing
MscL
alongside
other
species
of
mechanosensitive
channels,
but
not
for
MscL
alone.
This
suggests
that
MscL
responds
differently
to
different
rates
of
shock,
highlighting
the
need
for
further
study
of
rate
dependence
and
the
coordination
between
different
species
of
mechanosensitive
channels.
Fig.~\ref{fig:survival}
also
shows
that
several
hundred
channels
are
required
to
provide
appreciable
protection
from
osmotic
shock.
For a
survival
probability
of
80\%,
a cell
must
have
approximately
500 to
700
channels
per
cell
for a
fast
and
slow
shock,
respectively.
The
results
from
the
logistic
regression
are
showed
as
continuous
colored
curves.
The
individual
cell
measurements
separated
by
survival
and
death
are
shown
at the
top
and
bottom
of
each
plot,
respectively,
and
are
included
to
provide
a
sense
of
sampling
density.

~~~~Over
the
explored
range
of
MscL
copy
number,
we
observed
a
maximum
of
80\%
survival
for
any
binning
method.
The
remaining
20\%
survival
may be
attained
when
the
other
species
of
mechanosensitive
channels
are
expressed
alongside
MscL.
However,
it is
possible
that
the
flow
cell
method
performed
in
this
work
lowers
the
maximal
survival
fraction
as the
cells
are
exposed
to
several,
albeit
minor,
mechanical
stresses
such
as
loading
into
the
flow
cell
and
chemical
adherence
to the
glass
surface.
To
ensure
that
the
results
from
logistic
regression
accurately
describe
the
data,
we can
compare
the
survival
probabilities
to
those
using
the
binning
methods
described
earlier
(red
and
black
points,
Fig.~\ref{fig:survival}).
Nearly
all
binned
data
fall
within
error
of the
prediction
(see
Materials
\&
Methods
for
definition
of
error
bar on
probability),
suggesting
that
this
approach
accurately
reflects
the
survival
probability
and
gives
license
to
extrapolate
the
estimation
of
survival
probability
to
regions
of
outside
of our
experimentally
explored
copy
number
regime.

~~~~Thus
far,
we've
dictated
that
for a
given
rate
of
osmotic
shock
(i.e.
``fast''
or
``slow''),
the
survival
probability
is
dependent
only
on the
number
of
channels.

By no
means
are we
``finished''
with
any of
these
topics.
Rather,
it's
quite
the
opposite
in the
sense
that
having
a
handle
on the
biophysical
knobs
that
tune
the
behavior
opens
the
door
to a
litany
of new
scientific
questions.
In the
case
of
mechanosenstaion
and
osmoregulation,
we
have
only
recently
been
able
to
determine
some
of the
basic
facts
that
allow
us to
approach
this
fascinating
biological
phenomenon
biophysically.
The
dependence
of
survival
on
mechanosensitive
channel
abundance
is a
key
quantity
that
is
missing
from
our
collection
of
critical
facts.
To our
knowledge,
this
work
represents
the
first
attempt
to
quantitatively
control
the
abundance
of a
single
species
of
mechanosensitive
channel
and
examine
the
physiological
consequences
in
terms
of
survival
probability
at
single-cell
resolution.
Our
results
reveal
two
notable
quantities.
First,
out of
the
several
hundred
single-cell
measurements,
we
never
observed
a cell
which
had
less
than
approximately
100
channels
per
cell
and
survived
an
osmotic
shock,
irrespective
of the
shock
rate.
The
second
is
that
between
500
and
700
channels
per
cell
are
needed
to
provide
\(\geq 80\%\)
survival,
depending
on the
shock
rate.

~~~~Only
recently
has
the
relationship
between
the
MscL
copy
number
and
the
probability
of
survival
been
approached
experimentally.
In van
den
Berg
et al.
(2016),
the
authors
examined
the
contribution
of
MscL
to
survival
in a
genetic
background
where
all
other
known
mechanosensitive
channels
had
been
deleted
from
the
chromosome
and
plasmid-borne
expression
of an
MscL-mEos3.2
fusion
was
tuned
through
an
IPTG
inducible
promoter
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-vandenberg2016}{8}).
In
this
work,
they
measured
the
single-cell
channel
abundance
through
super-resolution
microscopy
and
queried
survival
through
bulk
assays.
They
report
a
nearly
linear
relationship
between
survival
and
copy
number,
with
approximately
100
channels
per
cell
conveying
100\%
survival.
This
number
is
significantly
smaller
than
our
observation
of
approximately
100
channels
as the
\emph{minimum}
number
needed
to
convey
<<<<<<< HEAD
an y
=======
any
>>>>>>> a7f1f48764c67f8af548b5f30711258794088eba
observable
degree
of
survival.

~~~~
The
disagreement
between
the
numbers
reported
in
this
work
and in
van
den
Berg
et al.
may
partially
arise
from
subtle
differences
in the
experimental
approach.
The
primary
practical
difference
is the
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
rate
and
>>>>>>> a7f1f48764c67f8af548b5f30711258794088eba
magnitude
of the
osmotic
shock.
van
den
Berg
et al.
applied
an
approximately
600
mOsm
downshock
in
bulk
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
at an
undetermined
rate
>>>>>>> a7f1f48764c67f8af548b5f30711258794088eba
whereas
we
applied
a 1
Osm
<<<<<<< HEAD
downshock,
which
would
lead
to
lower
survival
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-levina1999}{37}).
In
their
work,
the
uncertainty
in
both
the
MscL
channel
count
and
survival
probability
is
roughly
30\%
(Fig.
S14).
Given
this
uncertainty,
it is
reasonable
to
interpret
that
the
number
of
channels
needed
for
complete
protection
from
osmotic
downshock
is
between
100
and
250
per
cell.
The
uncertainty
in
determining
the
number
of
channels
per
cell
is
consistent
with
the
observed
width
of the
channel
number
distribution
of the
Shine-Dalgarno
sequence
mutants
used
in
this
work
(Fig.~\ref{fig:boxplot}B).
A
unique
property
of the
single-cell
measurements
performed
in
this
work
allow
is the
direct
observation
of
survival
or
death
of
individual
cells.
We
find
that
morphological
classification
and
classification
through
a
propidium
iodide
staining
agree
within
1\%
(Supplement
C).
The
bulk
plating
assays,
as are
used
in van
=======
downshock
at
controlled
rates
varying
from
0.02
Hz to
2.2
Hz. In
their
work,
survival
was
measured
through
plating
assays
which
represent
the
population
average
rather
than
the
distribution
of
survival
probability.
While
this
approach
provides
valuable
information
regarding
the
response
of a
population
to an
osmotic
shock,
the
high
survival
rate
may
stem
from a
wide
distribution
of
channel
copies
per
cell
in the
population
coupled
with
bulk-scale
measurement
of
survival.
As has
been
shown
in
this
work,
the
expression
of
MscL
from a
chromosomal
integration
is
noisy
with a
single
strain
exhibiting
MscL
copy
numbers
spanning
an
order
of
magnitude
or
more.
In van

den
Berg
et

<<<<<<< HEAD
rely
on
colony
formation
and
outgrowth
to
determine
survival
probability.
As is
reported
in
their
supplemental
information,
the
precision
in
this
measurement
is
around
30\%
(Fig.
S14).
Accounting
for
this
uncertainty
brings
both
measurements
within
a few
fold
where
we
still
consistently
observe
lower
survival
for a
given
channel
number.
This
remaining
disagreement
may be
accounted
for by
systematic
uncertainty
in
both
experimental
methods.

~~~~For
example,
variation
in the
length
of
outgrowth,
variable
shock
rate,
and
counting
statistics
could
bias
towards
higher
observed
survival
rates
in
ensemble
plating
assays.
During
the
outgrowth
phase,
the
control
sample
not
exposed
to an
osmotic
shock
is
allowed
to
grow
for
approximately
30
minutes
in a
high-salt
medium
before
plating.
The
shocked
cells,
however,
are
allowed
to
grow
in a
low-salt
medium.
We
have
found
that
the
difference
between
the
growth
rates
in
these
two
conditions
can be
appreciable
(approximately
35
minutes
versus
20
minutes,
respectively)
as can
be
seen
in Fig
S2.
Cells
that
survived
an
osmotic
shock
may
have a
growth
advantage
relative
to the
control
sample
if the
shock-induced
lag
phase
is
less
than
the
outgrowth,
leading
to
higher
observed
survival
rates
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-levina1999}{37}).
This
is one
possible
explanation
for
the
survival
rates
which
are
reported
in
excess
of
100\%.
Cells
that
survived
an
osmotic
shock
may
have a
growth
advantage
relative
to the
normalization
sample
if the
shock-induced
lag
phase
is
less
than
the
outgrowth,
leading
to
higher
observed
survival
rates,
even
surpassing
100\%.
We
have
performed
these
assays
ourselves
and
have
observed
survival
rates
above
of
100\%
(ranging
from
110\%
to
125\%)
with
an
approximate
30\%
error
(see
Fig.
S3 in
Bialecka-Fornal
et al.
2012
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-bialecka-fornal2012}{3}))
which
we
concluded
to
arise
from
differences
in
growth
rate.
We
also
note
that
survival
rates
greater
than
100\%
are
observed
in van
den
Berg
et al.
(Fig.
S14).
For
strains
that
have
survival
rates
between
80\%
and
100\%
the
uncertainty
is
typically
large,
making
it
difficult
to
make
precise
statements
regarding
when
full
survival
is
achieved.

~~~~It
has
been
shown
that
there
is a
strong
inverse
relationship
between
=======
this
variance
is
exacerbated
by
expression
of
MscL
from
an
inducible
plasmid
as
fluctuations
in the
gene
copy
number
from
plasmid
replication
and
segregation
influence
the
expression
level.
Connecting
such a
wide
and
complex
distribution
of
copy
numbers
to
single-cell
physiology
requires
the
consideration
of
moments
beyond
the
mean
which
is a
nontrivial
task.
Rather
than
trying
to
make
such a
connection,
we
queried
survival
at
single-cell
resolution
at the
expense
of a
lower
experimental
throughput.

~~~~Despite
these
experimental
differences,
the
results
of
this
work
and
van
den
Berg
et
al.,
are in
agreement
that
MscL
must
be
present
at the
level
of 100
or
more
channels
per
cell
in
wild-type
cells
to
convey
appreciable
survival.
As
both
of
these
works
were
performed
in a
strain
in
which
the
only
mechanosensitive
channel
was
MscL,
it
remains
unknown
how
the
presence
of the
other
channel
species
would
alter
the
number
of
MscL
needed
for
complete
survival.
In our
experiments,
we
observed
a
maximum
survival
probability
of
approximately
80\%
even
with
close
to
1000
MscL
channels
per
cell.
It is
possible
that
the
combined
effort
of the
six
other
mechanosensitive
channels
would
make
up for
some
if not
all of
the
remaining
20\%.
To
explore
the
contribution
of
another
channel
to
survival,
van
den
Berg
et al.
also
queried
the
contribution
of
MscS,
another
mechanosensitive
channel,
to
survival
in the
absence
of any
other
species
of
mechansensitive
channel.
It was
found
that
over
the
explored
range
of
MscS
channel
copy
numbers,
the
maximum
survival
rate
was
approximately
50\%,
suggesting
that
different
mechanosensitive
channels
have
an
upper
limit
to how
much
protection
they
can
confer.
Both
van
den
Berg
et al.
and
our
work
show
that
there
is
still
much
to be
learned
with
respect
to the
interplay
between
the
various
species
of
mechanosensitive
channel
as
well
as
their
regulation.

the

shock
and
survival
probability
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-bialecka-fornal2015}{4}).
Any
experiment
in
which
the
shock
was
applied
more
slowly
or
quickly
than
another
would
bias
toward
higher
or
lower
survivability,
respectively.
The
shocks
applied
in
bulk
assays
are
often
performed
manually
which
can be
highly
variable.
We
note
that
in our
experiments,
we
frequently
observe
cells
which
do not
separate
and
form
chains
of two
or
more
cells
(Fig.
S9 and
S10).
In
plating
assays,
it is
assumed
that
colonies
arise
from a
single
founding
cell
however
a
colony
formed
by a
cluster
of
living
and
dead
cells
would
be
interpreted
as a
single
surviving
cell,
effectively
masking
the
death
of the
others
in the
colony
forming
unit.
This
too
could
bias
the
measurement
toward
higher
survival
rates.
Single-cell
shock
experiments
can
also
have
systematic
errors
which
can
bias
the
results
towards
lower
survival
rates.
Such
errors
are
associated
with
handling
of the
cells
such
as
shear
damage
from
loading
into
the
flow
cell,
adhering
the
cells
to the
coverslip,
and
any
chemical
perturbations
introduced
by the
dye
used
to
measure
=======
down
shock
are
important
factors
in
determining
cell
survival
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-bialecka-fornal2015}{4}).
In
this
work,
we
show
that
this
finding
holds
true
for a
single
species
of
mechanosensitive
channel,
even
at
high
levels
of
expression.
One
might
naïvely
expect
that
this
rate-dependent
effect
would
disappear
once a
certain
threshold
of
channels
had
been
met.
Our
experiments,
however,
show
that
even
at
nearly
1000
channels
per
cell
the
predicted
survival
curves
for a
slow
(\(< 1.0\)
Hz)
and
fast
(\(\geq 1.0\)
Hz)
are
shifted
relative
to
each
other
with
the
fast
shock
predicting
lower
rates
of
survival.
This
suggests
either
we
have
not
reached
this
threshold
in our
experiments
or
there
is
more
to
understand
about
the
relationship
between
abundance,
channel
species,

naïvely
expect
that
this
rate-dependent
effect
would
disappear
once a
certain
threshold
of
channels
had
been
met.
Our
experiments,
however,
show
that
even
at
nearly
1000
channels
per
cell
the
predicted
survival
curves
for a
slow
(\(< 1.0\)
Hz)
and
fast
(\(\geq 1.0\)
Hz)
are
shifted
relative
to
each
other
with
the
fast
shock
predicting
lower
rates
of
survival.
This
suggests
either
we
have
not
reached
this
threshold
in our
experiments
or
there
is
more
to
understand
about
the
relationship
between
abundance,
channel
species,
and
the
shock
rate.

~~~~
Some
experimental
and
theoretical
treatments
suggest
that
only a
few
copies
of
MscL
or
MscS
should
be
necessary
for
100\%
protection
given
our
knowledge
of the
conductance
and
the
maximal
water
flux
through
the
channel
in its
open
state
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-louhivuori2010}{11},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-booth2014}{38}).
However,
recent
proteomic
studies
have
revealed
average
MscL
copy
numbers
to be
in the
range
of
several
hundred
per
cell,
depending
on the
condition,
as can
be
seen
in
Table
1
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-schmidt2016}{15},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-soufi2015}{16},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-li2014}{39}).
Studies
focusing
solely
on
MscL
have
shown
similar
counts
through
quantitative
Western
blotting
and
fluorescence
microscopy
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-bialecka-fornal2012}{3}).
Electrophysiology
studies
have
told
another
story
with
copy
number
estimates
ranging
between
4 and
100
channels
per
cell
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-stokes2003a}{17},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-blount1999}{40}).
These
measurements,
however,
measure
the
active
number
of
channels.
The
factors
regulating
channel
activity
in
these
experiments
could
be due
to
perturbations
during
the
sample
preparation
or
reflect
some
unknown
mechanism
of
regulation,
such
as the
presence
or
absence
of
interacting
cofactors
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-schumann2010}{41}).
The
work
described
here,
on the
other
hand,
measures
the
\emph{maximum}
number
of
channels
that
could
be
active
and
may be
able
to
explain
why
the
channel
abundance
is
higher
than
estimated
by
theoretical
means.
There
remains
much
more
to be
learned
about
the
regulation
of
activity
in
these
systems.
As the
\emph{in
vivo}
measurement
of
protein
copy
number
becomes
accessible
through
novel
single-cell
and
single-molecule
methods,
we
will
continue
to
collect
more
facts
about
this
fascinating
system
and
hopefully
connect
the
molecular
details
of
mechanosensation
with
perhaps
the
most
important
physiological
response
--
life
or
death.

\subsubsection{Bacterial
strains
and
growth
conditions}\label{bacterial-strains-and-growth-conditions}

The
bacterial
strains
are
described
in
Table
S3.
The
parent
strain
for
the
mutants
used
in
this
study
was
MJF641
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-edwards2012}{5})
(generously
provided
by
Drs.
Samantha
Miller
and
Ian
Booth),
a
strain
which
had
all
seven
mechanosensitive
channels
deleted.
The
MscL-sfGFP
coding
region
from
MLG910
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-bialecka-fornal2012}{3})
was
integrated
into
MJF641
by P1
transduction,
creating
the
strain
D6LG-Tn10.
Selection
pressure
for
MscL
integration
was
created
by
incorporating
an
osmotic
shock
into
the
transduction
protocol,
which
favored
the
survival
of
MscL-expressing
stains
relative
to
MJF641
by
\textasciitilde{}100-fold.
Screening
for
integration
candidates
was
based
on
fluorescence
expression
of
plated
colonies.
Successful
integration
was
verified
by
sequencing.
Attempts
to
transduce
RBS-modified
MscL-sfGFP
coding
regions
became
increasingly
inefficient
as the
targeted
expression
level
of
MscL
was
reduced.
This
was
due to
the
decreasing
fluorescence
levels
and
survival
rates
of the
integration
candidates.
Consequently,
Shine-Dalgarno
sequence
modifications
were
made
by
inserting
DNA
oligos
with
lambda
red-mediated
homologous
recombination,
i.e.,
recombineering
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-sharan2009}{42}).
The
oligos
had a
designed
mutation
(Fig.~\ref{fig:boxplot})
flanked
by
\textasciitilde{}25
base
pairs
that
matched
the
targeted
MscL
region
(Table
S4). A
two-step
recombineering
process
of
selection
followed
by
counter
selection
using
a
\emph{tetA-sacB}
gene
fusion
cassette
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-li2013}{43})
was
chosen
because
of its
capabilities
to
integrate
with
efficiencies
comparable
to P1
transduction
and
not
leave
antibiotic
resistance
markers
or
scar
sequences
in the
final
strain.
To
prepare
the
strain
D6LG-Tn10
for
this
scheme,
the
Tn10
transposon
containing
the
\emph{tetA}
gene
needed
to be
removed
to
avoid
interference
with
the
\emph{tetA-sacB}
cassette.
Tn10
was
removed
from
the
middle
of the
\emph{ycjM}
gene
with
the
primer
Tn10delR
(Table
S2) by
recombineering,
creating
the
strain
D6LG
(SD0).
Counter
selection
against
the
\emph{tetA}
gene
was
promoted
by
using
agar
media
with
fusaric
acid
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-li2013}{43},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-bochner1980}{44}).
The
\emph{tetA-sacB}
cassette
was
PCR
amplified
out of
the
strain
XTL298
using
primers
MscLSPSac
and
MscLSPSacR
(Table
S2).
The
cassette
was
integrated
in
place
of the
spacer
region
in
front
of the
MscL
start
codon
of
D6LG
(SD0)
by
recombineering,
creating
the
intermediate
strain
D6LTetSac.
Positive
selection
for
cassette
integration
was
provided
by
agar
media
with
tetracycline.
Finally,
the
RBS
modifying
oligos
were
integrated
into
place
by
replacing
the
\emph{tetA-sacB}
cassette
by
recombineering.
Counter
selection
against
both
\emph{tetA}
and
\emph{sacB}
was
ensured
by
using
agar
media
with
fusaric
acid
and
sucrose
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-li2013}{43}),
creating
the
Shine-Dalgarno
mutant
strains
used
in
this
work.

over
the
course
of the
experiment.
The
imaging
region
is
approximately
10 mm
wide
and
100
\(\mu\)m
in
depth.
All
imaging
took
place
within
1 -- 2
cm of
the
outlet
to
avoid
imaging
cells
within
a
non-uniform
gradient
of
osmolarity.
The
interior
of the
flow
cell
was
functionalized
with a
1:400
dilution
of
<<<<<<< HEAD
polyethylenimine
=======
polyethylamine
>>>>>>> a7f1f48764c67f8af548b5f30711258794088eba
prior
to
addition
of
cells
with
the
excess
washed
away
with
water.
A
dilute
cell
suspension
in LB
Lennox
with
500 mM
NaCl
was
loaded
into
one
inlet
while
the
other
was
connected
to a
vial
of LB
medium
with
no
NaCl.
This
hypotonic
medium
was
clamped
during
the
loading
of the
cells.

~ ~ ~
~Once
the
cells
had
adhered
to the

the
excess

were
washed
away
with
the
500 mM
NaCl
growth
medium
followed
by a
small
(\textasciitilde{}20
\(\mu\)L)
air
bubble.
This
air
bubble
forced
the
cells
to lay
flat
against
the
imaging
surface,
improving
the
time-lapse
imaging.
Over
the
observation
period,
cells
not
exposed
to an
osmotic
shock
were
able
to
grow
for 4
-- 6
divisions,
showing
that
the
flow
cell
does
not
directly
impede
cell
growth.

\subsubsection{Imaging
conditions}\label{imaging-conditions}

~ ~ ~
~All
imaging
was
performed
in a
flow
cell
held
at
30°C
on a
Nikon
Ti-Eclipse
microscope
outfitted
with a
Perfect
Focus
system
enclosed
in a
Haison
environmental
chamber
(approximately
1°C
regulation
efficiency).
The
microscope
was
equipped
with a
488 nm
laser
excitation
source
(CrystaLaser)
and a
520/35
laser
optimized
filter
set
(Semrock).
The
images
were
collected
on an

(27).
>>>>>>> a7f1f48764c67f8af548b5f30711258794088eba
Once
cells
were
securely
mounted
onto
the
surface
of the
glass
coverslip,
between
15 and
20
positions
containing
5 to
10
cells
were
marked
and
the
coordinates
recorded.
At
each
position,
a
phase
contrast
and
GFP
fluorescence
image
was
acquired
for
segmentation
and
subsequent
measurement
of
channel
copy
number.
To
perform
the
osmotic
shock,
LB
media
containing
no
NaCl
was
pulled
into
the
flow
cell
through
a
syringe
pump.
To
monitor
the
media
exchange,
both
the
high
salt
and no
salt
LB
media
were
supplemented
with a
low-affinity
version
of the
calcium-sensitive
dye
Rhod-2
(250
nM;
TEF
Labs)
which
fluoresces
when
bound
to
Ca\textsuperscript{2+}.
The no
salt
medium
was
also
supplemented
with
1\(\mu\)M
<<<<<<< HEAD
CaCl\(_2\)
=======
CaCl\textsubscript{2}
>>>>>>> a7f1f48764c67f8af548b5f30711258794088eba
to
make
the
media
mildly
fluorescent
and
the
exchange
rate
was
calculated
by
measuring
the
fluorescence
increase
across
an
illuminated
section
of one
of the
positions.
These
images
were
collected
in
real
time
for
the
duration
of the
shock.
The
difference
in
measured
fluorescence
between
the
pre-shock
images
and
those
at the
end of
the
shock
set
the
scale
of a
500 mM
NaCl
down
shock.
The
rate
was
calculated
by
fitting
a line
to the
middle
region
of
this
trace.

\subsubsection{Image
Processing}\label{image-processing}

~ ~ ~
~Images
were
processed
using
a
combination
of
automated
and
manual
methods.
First,
expression
of
MscL
was
measured
via
segmenting
individual
cells
or
small
clusters
of
cells
in
phase
contrast
and
computing
the
mean
pixel
value
of the
fluorescence
image
for
each
segmented
object.
The
fluorescence
images
were
passed
through
several
filtering
operations
which
reduced
high-frequency
noise
as
well
as
corrected
for
uneven
illumination
of the
excitation
wavelength.

~ ~ ~
~Survival
or
death
classification
was
performed
manually
using
the
CellProfiler
plugin
for
ImageJ
software
(NIH).
A
survivor
was
defined
as a
cell
which
was
able
to
undergo
<<<<<<< HEAD
at
least
=======
>>>>>>> a7f1f48764c67f8af548b5f30711258794088eba
two
division
events
after
the
osmotic
down
shock.
<<<<<<< HEAD
Cell
death
was
recognized
by
stark
changes
in
cell
morphology
including
loss
of
phase
contrast
through
ejection
of
cytoplasmic
material,
structural
decomposition
of the
cell
wall
and
membrane,
and
the
inability
to
divide.
To
confirm
that
these
morphological
cues
corresponded
with
cell
death,
we
probed
cell
viability
on a
subset
of our
strains
after
osmotic
shock
through
staining
with
propidium
iodide,
a DNA
intercalating
dye
commonly
used
to
identifying
dead
cells
(LIVE/DEAD
BacLight
Bacterial
Cell
Viability
Assay,
Thermo
Fisher).
We
found
that
our
classification
based
on
morphology
agreed
with
that
based
off of
staining
within
1\%.

became
indistinguishable
from
other
cells
due to
clustering
were
not
counted
as
survival

death
and
were
removed
from
the
dataset
completely.
A
region
of the
cell
was
manually
marked
with
1.0
(survival)
or 0.0
(death)
by
clicking
on the
image.
The
\texttt{xy}
coordinates
of the
click
as
well
as the
assigned
value
were
saved
as an
\texttt{.xml}
file
for
that
position.

~ ~ ~
~The
connection
between
the
segmented
cells
and
their
corresponding
manual
markers
was
automated.
As the
manual
markings
were
made
on the
first
phase
contrast
image
after
the
osmotic
shock,
small
shifts
in the
positions
of the
cell
made
one-to-one
mapping
with
the
segmentation
mask
non-trivial.
The
linkages
between
segmented
cell
and
manual
marker
were
made
by
computing
all
pairwise
distances
between
the
manual
marker
and
the
segmented
cell
centroid,
taking
the
shortest
distance
as the
true
pairing.
The
linkages
were
then
inspected
manually
and
incorrect
mappings
were
corrected
as
necessary.

~ ~ ~
~All
relevant
statistics
about
the
segmented
objects
as
well
as the
sample
identity,
date
of
acquisition,
osmotic
shock
rate,
and
camera
exposure
time
were
saved
as
\texttt{.csv}
files
for
each
individual
experiment.

procedure

\subsubsection{Calculation
of
effective
channel
copy
number}\label{calculation-of-effective-channel-copy-number}

~ ~ ~
~To
compute
the
MscL
channel
copy
number,
we
relied
on
measuring
the
fluorescence
level
of a
bacterial
strain
in
which
the
mean
MscL
channel
copy
number
was
known
via
fluorescence
microscopy
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-bialecka-fornal2012}{3}).
\emph{E.
coli}
strain
MLG910,
which
expresses
the
MscL-sfGFP
fusion
protein
from
the
wild-type
SD
sequence,
was
grown
under
identical
conditions
to
those
described
in
Bialecka-Fornal
et al.

to an
OD\textsubscript{600nm}
of
\textasciitilde{}0.3.
The
cells
were
then
diluted
ten
fold
and
immobilized
on a
rigid
2\%
agarose
substrate
and
placed
onto a
glass
bottom
petri
dish
and
imaged
in the
same
conditions
as
described
previously.

~ ~
~Images
were
taken
of six
biological
replicates
of
MLG910
and
were
processed
identically
to
those
in the
osmotic
shock
experiments.
A
calibration
factor
between
the
average
cell
fluorescence
level
and
mean
MscL
copy
number
was
then
computed.
We
assumed
that
all
measured
fluorescence
(after
filtering
and
background
subtraction)
was
derived
from
the
MscL-sfGFP
fusion,
\begin{equation}
\langle I_\text{tot}\rangle = \alpha \langle N \rangle,
\label{eq:ian}\end{equation}
in
which
\(\alpha\)
is the
calibration
factor
and
\(\langle N \rangle\)
is the
mean
cellular
MscL-sfGFP
copy
number
as
reported
in
Bialecka-Fornal
et al.
2012
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-bialecka-fornal2012}{3}).
To
correct
for
errors
in
segmentation,
the
intensity
was
computed
as an
areal
density
\(\langle I_A \rangle\)
and
was
multiplied
by the
average
cell
area
\(\langle A \rangle\)
of the
population.
The
calibration
factor
was
therefore
computed
as
\begin{equation}
\alpha = {\langle I_A \rangle \langle A \rangle \over \langle N \rangle}.
\label{eq:calibration_factor}\end{equation}

~~~We
used
Bayesian
inferential
methods
to
compute
this
calibration
factor
taking
measurement
error
and
replicate-to-replicate
variation
into
account.
The
resulting
average
cell
area
and
calibration
factor
was
used
to
convert
the
measured
cell
intensities
from
the
osmotic
shock
experiments
to
cell
copy
number.
The
details
of
this
inference
are
described
in
depth
in the
supplemental
information
(\emph{Standard
Candle
Calibration}).

\subsubsection{Logistic
regression}\label{logistic-regression}

~ ~ ~
~We
used
Bayesian
inferential
methods
to
find
the
most
probable
values
of the
coefficients
\(\beta_0\)
and
\(\beta_1\)
and
the
appropriate
credible
regions
and is
described
in
detail
in the
supplemental
information
(\emph{Logistic
Regression}).
Briefly,
we
used
Markov
chain
Monte
Carlo
(MCMC)
to
sample
from
the
log
posterior
distribution
and
took
the
most
probable
value
as the
mean
of the
samples
for
each
parameter.
The
MCMC
was
performed

programming
language

\subsubsection{Calculation
of
survival
probability
error}\label{calculation-of-survival-probability-error}

~~~~The
vertical
error
bars
for
the
points
shown
in
Fig.~\ref{fig:survival}
represent
our
uncertainty
in the
survival
probability
given
our
measurement
of
\(n\)
survivors
out of
a
total
\(N\)
single-cell
measurements.
The
probability
distribution
of the
survival
probability
\(p_s\)
given
these
measurements
can be
written
using
Bayes'
theorem
as
\begin{equation}
g(p_s\,\vert\, n, N) = {f(n\,\vert\,p_s, N)g(p_s) \over f(n\,\vert\, N)},
\label{eq:probability_bayes}\end{equation}
where
\(g\)
and
\(f\)
represent
probability
density
functions
over
parameters
and
data,
respectively.
The
likelihood
\(f(n\,\vert p_s, N)\)
represents
the
probability
of
measuring
\(n\)
survival
events,
given
a
total
of
\(N\)
measurements
each
with a
probability
of
survival
\(p_s\).
This
matches
the
story
for
the
Binomial
distribution
and
can be
written
as
\begin{equation}
f(n\,\vert\,p_s, N) = {N! \over n!(N - n)!}p_s^n(1 - p_s)^{N - n}.
\label{eq:binomial}\end{equation}
To
maintain
maximal
ignorance
we can
assume
that
any
value
for
\(p_s\)
is
valid,
such
that
is in
the
range
{[}0,
1{]}.
This
prior
knowledge,
represented
by
\(g(p_s)\),
can be
written
as
\begin{equation}
g(p_s) = \begin{cases}1 & 0\leq p_s\leq 1 \\
0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}.
\label{eq:uniform_prob}\end{equation}
We can
also
assume
maximal
ignorance
for
the
total
number
of
survival
events
we
could
measure
given
\(N\)
observations,
\(f(n\, \vert\, N)\).
Assuming
all
observations
are
equally
likely,
this
can be
written
as
\begin{equation}
f(n\,\vert\, N) = {1 \over N + 1}
\label{eq:evidence}\end{equation}
where
the
addition
of one
comes
from
the
possibility
of
observing
zero
survival
events.
Combining
Eqns.~\ref{eq:binomial}, \ref{eq:uniform_prob}, \ref{eq:evidence},
the
posterior
distribution
\(g(p_s\,\vert\, n, N)\)
is
\begin{equation}
g(p_s\,\vert\, n, N) = {(N+1)! \over n!(N - n)!}p_s^{n}(1 - p_s)^{N - n}.
\label{eq:probability_posterior}\end{equation}

~~~~
The
most
probable
value
of
\(p_s\),
where
the
posterior
probability
distribution
given
by
Eq.~\ref{eq:probability_posterior}
is
maximized,
can be
found
by
computing
the
point
at
which
derivative
of the
log
posterior
with
respect
to
\(p_s\)
goes
to
zero,
\begin{equation}
{d\log g(p_s\,\vert\,n, N) \over d p_s} = {n \over p_s} - {N - n  \over 1 - p_s} = 0.
\label{eq:deriv_ps}\end{equation}
Solving
Eq.~\ref{eq:deriv_ps}
for
\(p_s\)
gives
the
most
likely
value
for
the
probability,
\begin{equation}
p_s^* = {n \over N}.
\label{eq:most_prob_prob}\end{equation}
So
long
as
\(N >> np_s^*\),
Eq.~\ref{eq:probability_posterior}
can be
approximated
as a
Gaussian
distribution
with a
mean
\(p_s^*\)
and a
variance
\(\sigma_{p_s}^2\).
By
definition,
the
variance
of a
Gaussian
distribution
is
computed
as the
negative
reciprocal
of the
second
derivative
of the
log
posterior
evaluated
at
\(p_s = p_s^*\),
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{p_s}^2 = - \left({d^2 \log g(p_s\,\vert\, n, N) \over dp_s^2}\Bigg\vert_{p_s=p_s^*}\right)^{-1}.
\label{eq:variance_def}\end{equation}
Evaluating
Eq.~\ref{eq:variance_def}
yields
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{p_s}^2 = {n(N-n)\over N^3}.
\label{eq:prob_variance}\end{equation}
Given
Eq.~\ref{eq:most_prob_prob}
and
Eq.~\ref{eq:prob_variance},
the
most-likely
survival
probability
and
estimate
of the
uncertainty
can be
expressed
as
\begin{equation}
p_s = p_s^* \pm \sigma_{p_s}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Standard
Candle
Calibration}\label{standard-candle-calibration}

~~~~To
estimate
the
single-cell
MscL
abundance
via
microscopy,
we
needed
to
determine
a
calibration
factor
that
could
translate
arbitrary
fluorescence
units
to
protein
copy
number.
To
compute
this
calibration
factor,
we
relied
on
\emph{a

knowledge
of the
mean
copy
number
of
MscL-sfGFP
for a
particular
bacterial
strain
in
specific
growth
conditions.
In

et al.
2012
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-bialecka-fornal2012}{3}),
the
average
MscL
copy
number
for a
population
of
cells
expressing
an
MscL-sfGFP
fusion
(\emph{E.
coli}
K-12
MG1655
\(\phi\)(\emph{mscL-sfGFP}))
cells
was
measured
using
quantitative
Western
blotting
and
single-molecule
photobleaching
assays.
By
growing
this
strain
in
identical
growth
and
imaging
conditions,
we can
make
an
approximate
measure
of
this
calibration
factor.
In
this
section,
we
derive
a
statistical
model
for
estimating
the
most-likely
value
of
this
calibration
factor
and
its
associated
error.

\subsubsection{Definition
of a
calibration
factor}\label{definition-of-a-calibration-factor}

~~~~We
assume
that
all
detected
fluorescence
signal
from a
particular
cell
is
derived
from
the
MscL-sfGFP
protein,
after
background
subtraction
and
correction
for
autofluorescence.
The
arbitrary
units
of
fluorescence
can be
directly
related
to the
protein
copy
number
via a
calibration
factor
\(\alpha\),
\begin{equation}
I_\text{tot} = \alpha N_\text{tot},
\label{eq:ian}\end{equation}
where
\(I_\text{tot}\)
is the
total
cell
fluorescence
and
\(N_\text{tot}\)
is the
total
number
of
MscL
proteins
per
cell.
Bialecka-Fornal
et al.
report
the
average
cell
Mscl
copy
number
for
the
population
rather
than
the
distribution.
Knowing
only
the
mean,
we can
rewrite
Eq.~\ref{eq:ian}
as
\begin{equation}
\langle I_\text{tot}\rangle = \alpha \langle N_\text{tot} \rangle,
\label{eq:avg_ian}\end{equation}
assuming
that
\(\alpha\)
is a
constant
value
that
does
not
change
from
cell
to
cell
or
fluorophore
to
fluorophore.

~~~~The
experiments
presented
in
this
work
were
performed
using
non-synchronously
growing
cultures.
As
there
is a
uniform
distribution
of
growth
phases
in the
culture,
the
cell
size
distribution
is
broad
the
the
extremes
being
small,
newborn
cells
and
large
cells
in the
process
of
division.
As
described
in the
main
text,
the
cell
size
distribution
of a
population
is
broadened
further
by
modulating
the
MscL
copy
number
with
low
copy
numbers
resulting
in
aberrant
cell
morphology.
To
speak
in the
terms
of an
effective
channel
copy
number,
we
relate
the
average
areal
intensity
of the
population
to the
average
cell
size,
\begin{equation}
\langle I_\text{tot} \rangle = \langle I_A \rangle \langle A \rangle = \alpha \langle N_\text{tot} \rangle,
\label{eq:area_conversion}\end{equation}
where
\(\langle I_A\rangle\)
is the
average
areal
intensity
in
arbitrary
units
per
pixel
of the
population
and
\(\langle A \rangle\)
is the
average
area
of a
segmented
cell.
As
only
one
focal
plane
was
imaged
in
these
experiments,
we
could
not
compute
an
appropriate
volume
for
each
cell
given
the
highly
aberrant
morphology.
We
therefore
opted
to use
the
projected
two-dimensional
area
of
each
cell
as a
proxy
for
cell
size.
Given
this
set of
measurements,
the
calibration
factor
can be
computed
as
\begin{equation}
\alpha = {\langle I_A \rangle\langle A \rangle \over \langle N_\text{tot} \rangle}.
\label{eq:simple_cal_factor}\end{equation}

~~~~While
it is
tempting
to use
Eq.~\ref{eq:simple_cal_factor}
directly,
there
are
multiple
sources
of
error
that
are
important
to
propagate
through
the
final
calculation.
The
most
obvious
error
to
include
is the
measurement
error
reported
in
Bialecka-Fornal
et al.
2012
for
the
average
MscL
channel
count
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-bialecka-fornal2012}{3}).
There
are
also
slight
variations
in
expression
across
biological
replicates
that
arise
from a
myriad
of
day-to-day
differences.
Rather
than
abstracting
all
sources
of
error
away
into a
systematic
error
budget,
we
used
an
inferential
model
derived
from
Bayes'
theorem
that
allows
for
the
computation
of the
probability
distribution
of
\(\alpha\).

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Estimation
of
\(\alpha\)
for a
single
biological
replicate}{Estimation of \textbackslash{}alpha for a single biological replicate}}\label{estimation-of-alpha-for-a-single-biological-replicate}

~~~~A
single
data
set
consists
of
several
hundred
single-cell
measurements
of
intensity,
area
of the
segmentation
mask,
and
other
morphological
quantities.
The
areal
density
\(I_A\)
is
computed
by
dividing
the
total
cell
fluorescence
by the
cell
area
\(A\).
We are
interested
in
computing
the
probability
distributions
for
the
calibration
factor
\(\alpha\),
the
average
cell
area
\(\langle A \rangle\),
and
the
mean
number
of
channels
per
cell
\(\langle N_\text{tot} \rangle\)
for
the
data
set as
a
whole
given
only
\(I_A\)
and
\(A\).
Using
Bayes'
theorem,
the
probability
distribution
for
these
parameters
given
a
single
cell
measurement,
hereafter
called
the
posterior
distribution,
can be
written
as
\begin{equation}
g(\alpha, \langle A \rangle, \langle N_\text{tot} \rangle\,\vert\, A, I_A) = {f(A, I_A\,\vert
\, \alpha,\langle A \rangle, \langle N_\text{tot} \rangle) g(\alpha,\langle A \rangle, \langle N_\text{tot} \rangle) \over f(\alpha, I_A)},
\label{eq:simple_bayes}\end{equation}
where
\(g\)
and
\(f\)
represent
probability
density
functions
over
parameters
and
data,
respectively.
The
term
\(f(A, I_A\,\vert\, \alpha, \langle A \rangle, \langle N_\text{tot} \rangle)\)
in the
numerator
represents
the
likelihood
of
observing
the
areal
intensity
\(I_A\)
and
area
\(A\)
of a
cell
for a
given
values
of
\(\alpha\),
\(\langle A \rangle\),
and
\(\langle N_\text{tot} \rangle\).
The
second
term
in the
numerator
\(g(\alpha,\langle A \rangle, \langle N_\text{tot} \rangle)\)
captures
all
prior
knowledge
we
have
regarding
the
possible
values
of
these
parameters
knowing
nothing
about
the
measured
data.
The
denominator,
\(f(I_A, A)\)
captures
the
probability
of
observing
the
data
knowing
nothing
about
the
parameter
values.
This
term,
in our
case,
serves
simply
as a
normalization
constant
and is
neglected
for
the
remainder
of
this
section.

~~~~To
determine
the
appropriate
functional
form
for
the
likelihood
and
prior,
we
must
make
some
assumptions
regarding
the
biological
processes
that
generate
them.
As
there
are
many
independent
processes
that
regulate
the
timing
of
cell
division
and
cell
growth,
such
as DNA
replication
and
peptidoglycan
synthesis,
it is
reasonable
to
assume
that
for a
given
culture
the
distribution
of
cell
size
would
be
normally
distributed
with a
mean
of
\(\langle A \rangle\)
and a
variance
\(\sigma_{\langle A \rangle}\).
Mathematically,
we can
write
this
as
\begin{equation}
f(A\,\vert\,\langle A \rangle, \sigma_{\langle A \rangle}) \propto {1 \over \sigma_{\langle A \rangle}}\exp\left[-{(A - \langle A \rangle)^2 \over 2\sigma_{\langle A \rangle}^2}\right],
\label{eq:area_likelihood}\end{equation}
where
the
proportionality
results
from
dropping
normalization
constants
for
notational
simplicity.

~~~~
While
total
cell
intensity
is
intrinsically
dependent
on the
cell
area
the
areal
intensity
\(I_A\)
is
independent
of
cell
size.
The
myriad
processes
leading
to the
detected
fluorescence,
such
as
translation
and
proper
protein
folding,
are
largely
independent,
allowing
us to
assume
a
normal
distribution
for
\(I_A\)
as
well
with a
mean
\(\langle I_A \rangle\)
and a
variance
\(\sigma_{I_A}^2\).
However,
we do
not
have
knowledge
of the
average
areal
intensity
for
the
standard
candle
strain
\emph{a
priori}.
This
can be
calculated
knowing
the
calibration
factor,
total
MscL
channel
copy
number,
and
the
average
cell
area
as
\begin{equation}
I_A =  {\alpha\langle N_\text{tot} \rangle \over \langle A \rangle}.
\label{eq:avg_rho}\end{equation}
Using
Eq.~\ref{eq:avg_rho}
to
calculate
the
expected
areal
intensity
for
the
population,
we can
write
the
likelihood
as a
Gaussian
distribution,
\begin{equation}
f(I_A\,\vert\,\alpha,\langle A \rangle,\langle N_\text{tot} \rangle, \sigma_{I_A}) \propto {1 \over \sigma_{I_A}}\exp\left[-{\left(I_A - {\alpha \langle N_\text{tot} \rangle\over \langle A \rangle}\right)^2 \over 2 \sigma_{I_A}^2}\right].
\label{eq:rho_likelihood}\end{equation}

~~~~With
these
two
likelihoods
in
hand,
we are
tasked
with
determining
the
appropriate
priors.
As we
have
assumed
normal
distributions
for
the
likelihoods
of
\(\langle A \rangle\)
and
\(I_A\),
we
have
included
two
additional
parameters,
\(\sigma_{\langle A \rangle}\)
and
\(\sigma_{I_A}\),
each
requiring
their
own
prior
probability
distribution.
It is
common
practice
to
assume
maximum
ignorance
for
these
variances
and
use a
Jeffreys
prior
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-sivia2006}{49}),
\begin{equation}
g(\sigma_{\langle A \rangle}, \sigma_{I_A}) = {1 \over \sigma_{\langle A \rangle}\sigma_{I_A}}.
\label{eq:jeffreys}\end{equation}

~~~~The
next
obvious
prior
to
consider
is for
the
average
channel
copy
number
\(\langle N_\text{tot} \rangle\),
which
comes
from
Bialecka-Fornal
et al.
2012.
In
this
work,
they
report
a mean
\(\mu_N\)
and
variance
\(\sigma_N^2\),
allowing
us to
assume
a
normal
distribution
for
the
prior,
\begin{equation}
g(\langle N_\text{tot}\rangle\,\vert\, \mu_N,\sigma_N) \propto {1 \over \sigma_N}\exp\left[-{(\langle N_\text{tot} \rangle - \mu_N)^2 \over 2 \sigma_N^2}\right].
\label{eq:informative_prior}\end{equation}
For
\(\alpha\)
and
\(\langle A \rangle\),
we
have
some
knowledge
of
what
these
parameters
can
and
cannot
be.
For
example,
we
know
that
neither
of
these
parameters
can be
negative.
As we
have
been
careful
to not
overexpose
the
microscopy
images,
we can
say
that
the
maximum
value
of
\(\alpha\)
would
be the
bit-depth
of our
camera.
Similarly,
it is
impossible
to
segment
a
single
cell
with
an
area
larger
than
our
camera's
field
of
view
(although
there
are
biological
limitations
to
size
below
this
extreme).
To
remain
maximally
uninformative,
we can
assume
that
the
parameter
values
are
uniformly
distributed
between
these
bounds,
allowing
us to
state
\begin{equation}
g(\alpha) = \begin{cases} {1 \over \alpha_\text{max} - \alpha_\text{min}} & \alpha_\text{min} \leq \alpha \leq \alpha_\text{max} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases},
\label{eq:alpha_uniform_prior}\end{equation}
for
\(\alpha\)
and
\begin{equation}
g(\langle A \rangle) = \begin{cases} {1 \over \langle A \rangle_\text{max} - \langle A \rangle_\text{min}} & \langle A \rangle_\text{min} \leq \langle A \rangle \leq \langle A \rangle_\text{max}\\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\label{eq:area_uniform_prior}\end{equation}
for
\(\langle A \rangle\).

Piecing
Eq.~\ref{eq:area_likelihood}
through
Eq.~\ref{eq:area_uniform_prior}
together
generates
a
complete
posterior
probability
distribution
for
the
parameters
given
a
single
cell
measurement.
This
can be
generalized
to a
set of
\(k\)
single
cell
measurements
as
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
g(\alpha,\langle A \rangle, \langle N_\text{tot} \rangle, \sigma_{I_A}, \sigma_{\langle A \rangle}\,\vert\, [I_A, A], \mu_N, \sigma_N) &\propto {1 \over (\alpha_\text{max} - \alpha_\text{min})(\langle A \rangle_\text{max} - \langle A \rangle_\text{min})}{1 \over (\sigma_{I_A}\sigma_{\langle A \rangle})^{k+1}}\,\times\\
&{1 \over \sigma_N}\exp\left[- {(\langle N_\text{tot}\rangle - \mu_N)^2 \over 2\sigma_N^2}\right]
\prod\limits_i^k\exp\left[-{(A^{(i)} - \langle A \rangle)^2 \over 2\sigma_{\langle A \rangle}^2} - {\left(I_A^{(i)} - {\alpha \langle N_\text{tot}\rangle \over \langle A \rangle}\right)^2 \over 2\sigma_{I_A}^2}\right] \end{aligned},
\label{eq:single_rep_post}\end{equation}
where
\([I_A, A]\)
represents
the
set of
\(k\)
single-cell
measurements.

~~~~As
small
variations
in the
day-to-day
details
of
cell
growth
and
sample
preparation
can
alter
the
final
channel
count
of the
standard
candle
strain,
it is
imperative
to
perform
more
than a
single
biological
replicate.
However,
properly
propagating
the
error
across
replicates
is non
trivial.
One
option
would
be to
pool
together
all
measurements
of
\(n\)
biological
replicates
and
evaluate
the
posterior
given
in
Eq.~\ref{eq:single_rep_post}.
However,
this
by
definition
assumes
that
there
is no
difference
between
replicates.
Another
option
would
be to
perform
this
analysis
on
each
biological
replicate
individually
and
then
compute
a mean
and
standard
deviation
of the
resulting
most-likely
parameter
estimates
for
\(\alpha\)
and
\(\langle A \rangle\).
While
this
is a
better
approach
than
simply
pooling
all
data
together,
it
suffers
a bias
from
giving
each
replicate
equal
weight,
skewing
the
estimate
of the
most-likely
parameter
value
if one
replicate
is
markedly
brighter
or
dimmer
than
the
others.
Given
this
type
of
data
and a
limited
number
of
biological
replicates
(\(n = 6\)
in
this
work),
we
chose
to
extend
the
Bayesian
analysis
presented
in
this
section
to
model
the
posterior
probability
distribution
for
\(\alpha\)
and
\(\langle A \rangle\)
as a
hierarchical
process
in
which
\(\alpha\)
and
\(\langle A \rangle\)
for
each
replicate
is
drawn
from
the
same
distribution.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{A
hierarchical
model
for
estimating
\(\alpha\)}{A hierarchical model for estimating \textbackslash{}alpha}}\label{a-hierarchical-model-for-estimating-alpha}

~~~~In
the
previous
section,
we
assumed
maximally
uninformative
priors
for
the
most-likely
values
of
\(\alpha\)
and
\(\langle A \rangle\).
While
this
is a
fair
approach
to
take,
we are
not
completely
ignorant
with
regard
to how
these
values
are
distributed
across
biological
replicates.
A
major
assumption
of our
model
is
that
the
most-likely
value
of
\(\alpha\)
and
\(\langle A \rangle\)
for
each
biological
replicate
are
comparable,
so
long
as the
experimental
error
between
them
is
minimized.
In
other
words,
we are
assuming
that
the
most-likely
value
for
each
parameter
for
each
replicate
is
drawn
from
the
same
distribution.
While
each
replicate
may
have a
unique
value,
they
are
all
related
to one
another.
Unfortunately,
proper
sampling
of
this
distribution
requires
an
extensive
amount
of
experimental
work,
making
inferential
approaches
more
attractive.

This
approach,
often
called
a
multi-level
or
hierarchical
model,
is
schematized
in
Fig.~\ref{fig:hierarchical_model}.
Here,
we use
an
informative
prior
for
\(\alpha\)
and
\(\langle A \rangle\)
for
each
biological
replicate.
This
informative
prior
probability
distribution
can be
described
by
summary
statistics,
often
called
hyper-parameters,
which
are
then
treated
as the
``true''
value
and
are
used
to
calculate
the
channel
copy
number.
As
this
approach
allows
us to
get a
picture
of the
probability
distribution
of the
hyper-parameters,
we are
able
to
report
a
point
estimate
for
the
most-likely
value
along
with
an
error
estimate
that
captures
all
known
sources
of
variation.

\begin{figure}

replicate
(middle

cell
area
and
areal
intensity

evaluation

likelihood.}\label{fig:hierarchical_model}
\end{figure}

~~~~The
choice
for
the
functional
form
for
the
informative
prior
is
often
not
obvious
and
can
require
other
experimental
approaches
or
back-of-the-envelope
estimates
to
approximate.
Each
experiment
in
this
work
was
carefully
constructed
to
minimize
the
day-to-day
variation.
This
involved
adhering
to
well-controlled
growth
temperatures
and
media
composition,
harvesting
of
cells
at
comparable
optical
densities,
and
ensuring
identical
imaging
parameters.
As the
experimental
variation
is
minimized,
we can
use
our
knowledge
of the
underlying
biological
processes
to
guess
at the
approximate
functional
form.
For
similar
reasons
presented
in the
previous
section,
cell
size
is
controlled
by a
myriad
of
independent
processes.
As
each
replicate
is
independent
of
another,
it is
reasonable
to
assume
a
normal
distribution
for
the
average
cell
area
for
each
replicate.
This
normal
distribution
is
described
by a
mean
\(\tilde{\langle A \rangle}\)
and
variance
\(\tilde{\sigma}_{\langle A \rangle}\).
Therefore,
the
prior
for
\(\langle A \rangle\)
for
\(n\)
biological
replicates
can be
written
as
\begin{equation}
g(\langle A \rangle\, \vert\, \tilde{\langle A \rangle}, \tilde{\sigma}_{\langle A \rangle}) \propto {1 \over \tilde{\sigma}_{\langle A \rangle}^n}\prod\limits_{j=1}^{n}\exp\left[-{(\langle A \rangle_j - \tilde{\langle A \rangle})^2 \over 2 \tilde{\sigma}_{\langle A \rangle}^2}\right].
\label{eq:hyperprior_area}\end{equation}
In a
similar
manner,
we can
assume
that
the
calibration
factor
for
each
replicate
is
normally
distributed
with a
mean
\(\tilde{\alpha}\)
and
variance
\(\tilde{\sigma}_\alpha\),
\begin{equation}
g(\alpha\,\vert\,\tilde{\alpha}, \tilde{\sigma}_\alpha) \propto {1 \over \tilde{\sigma}_\alpha^n}\prod\limits_{j=1}^n \exp\left[-{(\alpha_j - \tilde{\alpha})^2 \over 2\tilde{\sigma}_\alpha^2}\right].
\label{eq:hyperprior_alpha}\end{equation}

~~~~With
the
inclusion
of two
more
normal
distributions,
we
have
introduced
four
new
parameters,
each
of
which
needing
their
own
prior.
However,
our
knowledge
of the
reasonable
values
for
the
hyper-parameters
has
not
changed
from
those
described
for a
single
replicate.
We can
therefore
use
the
same
maximally
uninformative
Jeffreys
priors
given
in
Eq.~\ref{eq:jeffreys}
for
the
variances
and
the
uniform
distributions
given
in
Eq.~\ref{eq:alpha_uniform_prior}
and
Eq.~\ref{eq:area_uniform_prior}
for
the
means.
Stitching
all of
this
work
together
generates
the
full
posterior
probability
distribution
for
the
best-estimate
of
\(\tilde{\alpha}\)
and
\(\tilde{\langle A \rangle}\)
shown
in
Eq.~\ref{eq:avg_ian}
given
\(n\)
replicates
of
\(k\)
single
cell
measurements,
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}

~~~~While
Eq.~\ref{eq:cal_factor_posterior}
is not
analytically
solvable,
it can
be
easily
sampled
using
Markov

Monte

(MCMC).
The
results
of the
MCMC
sampling
for
\(\tilde{\alpha}\)
and
\(\tilde{\langle A \rangle}\)
can be
seen
in
Fig.~\ref{fig:posterior_samples}.
From
this
approach,
we
found
the
most-likely
parameter
values
of
\(3300^{+700}_{-700}\)
a.u.
per
MscL
channel
and
\(5.4^{+0.4}_{-0.5}\)

for
\(\tilde{\alpha}\)

\(\tilde{\langle A \rangle}\),
respectively.

we've

\subsubsection{Effect
of
correction}\label{effect-of-correction}

~~~~
The
posterior
distributions
for
\(\alpha\)
and
\(\langle A \rangle\)
shown
in
Fig.~\ref{fig:posterior_samples}
were
used
directly
to
compute
the
most-likely
channel
copy
number
for
each
measurement
of the
Shine-Dalgarno
mutant
strains,
as is
described
in the
coming
section
(\emph{Logistic
Regression}).
The
importance
of
this
correction
can be
seen
in
Fig.~\ref{fig:area_correction}.
Cells
with
low
abundance
of
MscL
channels
exhibit
notable
morphological
defects,
as
illustrated
in
Fig.~\ref{fig:area_correction}A.
While
these
would
all be
considered
single
cells,
the
two-dimensional
area
of
each
may be
comparable
to two
or
three
wild-type
cells.
For
all of
the
Shine-Dalgarno
mutants,
the
distribution
of
projected
cell
area
has a
long
tail,
with
the
extremes
reaching
35
µm\(^2\)
per
cell
(Fig.~\ref{fig:area_correction}B).
Calcuating
the
total
number
of
channels
per
cell
does
nothing
to
decouple
this
correlation
between
cell
area
and
measured
cell
intensity.
Fig.~\ref{fig:area_correction}C
shows
the
correlation
between
cell
area
and
the
total
number
of
channels
without
normalizing
to an
average
cell
size
\(\langle A \rangle\)
differentiated
by
their
survival
after
an
osmotic
down-shock.
This
correlation
is
removed
by
calculating
an
effective
channel
copy
number
shown
in
Fig.~\ref{fig:area_correction}D.

\subsection{Shock
Classification}\label{shock-classification}

~~~~Its
been
previously
shown
that
the
rate
of
hypo-osmotic
shock
dictates
the
survival
probability
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-bialecka-fornal2015}{4}).
To
investigate
how a
single
channel
contributes
to
survival,
we
queried
survival
at
several
shock
rates
with
varying
MscL
copy
number.
In the
main
text
of
this
work,
we
separated
our
experiments
into
arbitrary
bins
of
``fast''
(\(\geq\)
1.0
Hz)
and
``slow''
(\(<\)
1.0
Hz)
shock
rates.
In
this
section,
we
discuss
our
rationale
for
coarse
graining
our
data
into
these
two
groupings.

~~~~As
is
discussed
in the
main
text
and in
the
supplemental
section
\emph{Logistic
Regression},
we
used a
bin-free
method
of
estimating
the
survival
probability
given
the
MscL
channel
copy
number
as a
predictor
variable.
While
this
method
requires
no
binning
of the
data,
it
requires
a data
set
that
sufficiently
covers
the
physiological
range
of
channel
copy
number
to
accurately
allow
prediction
of
survivability.
Fig.~\ref{fig:indiv_shock_group}
shows
the
results
of the
logistic
regression
treating
each
shock
rate
as an
individual
data
set.
The
most
striking
feature
of the
plots
shown
in
Fig.~\ref{fig:indiv_shock_group}
is the
inconsistent
behavior
of the
predicted
survivability
from
shock
rate
to
shock
rate.
The
appearance
of
bottle
necks
in the
credible
regions
for
some
shock
rates
(0.2Hz,
0.5Hz,
2.00Hz,
and
2.20
Hz)
appear
due to
a high
density
of
measurements
within
a
narrow
range
of the
channel
copy
number
at the
narrowest
point
in the
bottle
neck.
While
this
results
in a
seemingly
accurate
prediction
of the
survival
probability
at
that
point,
the
lack
of
data
in
other
copy
number
regimes
severely
limits
our
extrapolation
outside
of the
copy
number
range
of
that
data
set.
Other
shock
rates
(0.018
Hz,
0.04
Hz,
and
1.00
Hz)
demonstrate
completely
pathological
survival
probability
curves
due to
either
complete
survival
or
complete
death
of the
population.

~~~~Ideally,
we
would
like
to
have a
wide
range
of
MscL
channel
copy
numbers
at
each
shock
rate
shown
in
Fig.~\ref{fig:indiv_shock_group}.
However,
the
low-throughput
nature
of
these
single-cell
measurements
prohibits
completion
of
this
within
a
reasonable
time
frame.
It is
also
unlikely
that
thoroughly
dissecting
the
shock
rate
dependence
will
change
the
overall
finding
from
our
work
that
several
hundred
MscL
channels
are
needed
to
convey
survival
under
hypo-osmotic
stress.

\end{figure}

~~~~
Given
the
data
shown
in
Fig.~\ref{fig:indiv_shock_group},
we can
try to
combine
the
data
sets
into
several
bins.
Fig.~\ref{fig:three_shock_group}
shows
the
data
presented
in
Fig.~\ref{fig:indiv_shock_group}
separated
into
``slow''
(\(<\)
0.5
Hz,
A),
``intermediate''
(0.5 -
1.0
Hz,
B),
and
``fast''
(\(>\)
1.0
Hz, C)
shock
groups.
Using
these
groupings,
the
full
range
of
MscL
channel
copy
numbers
are
covered
for
each
case,
with
the
intermediate
shock
rate
sparsely
sampling
copy
numbers
greater
than
200
channels
per
cell.
In all
three
of
these
cases,
the
same
qualitative
story
is
told
--
several
hundred
channels
per
cell
are
necessary
for an
appreciable
level
of
survival
when
subjected
to an
osmotic
shock.
This
argument
is
strengthened
when
examining
the
predicted
survival
probability
by
considering
all
shock
rates
as a
single
group,
shown
in
Fig.~\ref{fig:three_shock_group}D.
This
treatment
tells
nearly
the
same
quantitative
and
qualitative
story
as the
three
rate
grouping
shown
in
this
section
and
the
two
rate
grouping
presented
in the
main
text.
While
there
does
appear
to be
a
dependence
on the
shock
rate
for
survival
when
only
MscL
is
expressed,
the
effect
is
relatively
weak
with
overlapping
credible
regions
for
the
logistic
regression
across
the
all
curves.
To
account
for
the
sparse
sampling
of
high
copy
numbers
observed
in the
intermediate
shock
group,
we
split
this
set
and
partitioned
the
measurements
into
either
the
``slow''
(\(<\)
1.0
Hz) or
``fast''
(\(\geq\)
1.0
Hz)
groups
presented
in the
main
text
of
this
work.

\subsection{Logistic
Regression}\label{logistic-regression-1}

~~~~In
this
work,
we
were
interested
in
computing
the
survival
probability
under
a
large
hypo-osmotic
shock
as a
function
of
MscL
channel
number.
As the
channel
copy
number
distributions
for
each
Shine-Dalgarno
sequence
mutant
were
broad
and
overlapping,
we
chose
to
calculate
the
survival
probability
through
logistic
regression
-- a
method
that
requires
no
binning
of the
data
providing
the
least
biased
estimate
of
survival
probability.
Logistic
regression
is a
technique
that
has
been
used
in
medical
statistics
since
the
late
1950's
to
describe
diverse
phenomena
such
as
dose
response
curves,
criminal
recidivism,
and
survival
probabilities
for
patients
after
treatment
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-anderson2003}{22},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-mishra2016}{23},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-stahler2013}{50}).
It has
also
found
much
use in
machine
learning
to
tune a
binary
or
categorical
response
given
a
continuous
input
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-cheng2009}{51}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-ng}{53}).

~~~~In
this
section,
we
derive
a
statistical
model
for
estimating
the
most-likely
values
for
the
coefficients
\(\beta_0\)
and
\(\beta_1\)
and
use
Bayes'
theorem
to
provide
an
interpretation
for
the
statistical
meaning.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Bayesian
parameter
estimation
of
\(\beta_0\)
and
\(\beta_1\)}{Bayesian parameter estimation of \textbackslash{}beta\_0 and \textbackslash{}beta\_1}}\label{bayesian-parameter-estimation-of-beta_0-and-beta_1}

~~~~The
central
challenge
of
this
work
is to
estimate
the
probability
of
survival
\(p_s\)
given
only a
measure
of the
total
number
of
MscL
channels
in
that
cell.
In
other
words,
for a
given
measurement
of
\(N_c\)
channels,
we
want
to
know
likelihood
that a
cell
would
survive
an
osmotic
shock.
Using
Bayes'
theorem,
we can
write
a
statistical
model
for
the
survival
probability
as
\begin{equation}
g(p_s\,\vert\, N_c) = {f(N_c\,\vert\, p_s)g(p_s) \over f(N_c)},
\label{eq:bayes_surv_prob}\end{equation}

where
\(g\)
and
\(f\)
represent
probability
density
functions
over
parameters
and
data,
respectively.
The
posterior
probability
distribution
\(g(p_s\,\vert\, N_c)\)
describes
the
probability
of
\(p_s\)
given
a
specific
number
of
channels
\(N_c\).
This
distribution
is
dependent
on the
likelihood
of
observing
\(N_c\)
channels
assuming
a
value
of
\(p_s\)
multiplied
by all
prior
knowledge
we
have
about
knowing
nothing
about
the
data,
\(g(s)\).
The
denominator
\(f(N_c)\)
in
Eq.~\ref{eq:bayes_surv_prob}
captures
all
knowledge
we
have
about
the
available
values
of
\(N_c\),
knowing
nothing
about
the
true
survival
probability.
As
this
term
acts
as a
normalization
constant,
we
will
neglect
it in
the
following
calculations
for
convenience.

~~~~To
begin,
we
must
come
up
with a
statistical
model
that
describes
the
experimental
measurable
in our
experiment
--
survival
or
death.
As
this
is a
binary
response,
we can
consider
each
measurement
as a
Bernoulli
trial
with a
probability
of
success
matching
our
probability
of
survival
\(p_s\),
\begin{equation}
f(s\, \vert\, p_s) = p_s^s(1 - p_s)^{1-s},
\label{eq:bernoulli}\end{equation}
where
\(s\)
is the
binary
response
of
\(1\)
or
\(0\)
for
survival
and
death,
respectively.
As is
stated
in the
introduction
to
this
section,
we
decided
to use
a
logistic
function
to
describe
the
survival
probability.
We
assume
that
the
log-odds
of
survival
is
linear
with
respect
to the
effective
channel
copy
number
\(N_c\)
as
\begin{equation}
\log{p_s \over 1 - p_s} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 N_c,
\label{eq:logit}\end{equation}
where
\(\beta_0\)
and
\(\beta_1\)
are
coefficients
which
describe
the
survival
probability
in the
absence
of
channels
and
the
increase
in
log-odds
of
survival
conveyed
by a
single
channel.
The
rationale
behind
this
interpretation
is
presented
in the
following
section,
\emph{A
Bayesian
interpretation
of
\(\beta_0\)
and
\(\beta_1\)}.
Using
this
assumption,
we can
solve
for
the
survival
probability
\(p_s\)
as,
\begin{equation}
p_s = {1 \over 1 + e^{-\beta_0 -\beta_1 N_c}}.
\label{eq:logistic_prob}\end{equation}

With a
functional
form
for
the
survival
probability,
the
likelihood
stated
in
Eq.~\ref{eq:bayes_surv_prob}
can be
restated
as
\begin{equation}
f(N_c, s\,\vert\,\beta_0,\beta_1) = \left({1 \over 1 + e^{-\beta_0 - \beta_1 N_c}}\right)^s\left(1 - {1 \over 1 + e^{-\beta_0 - \beta_1 N_c}}\right)^{1 - s}.
\label{eq:bernoulli_likelihood}\end{equation}
As we
have
now
introduced
two
parameters,
\(\beta_0\),
and
\(\beta_1\),
we
must
provide
some
description
of our
prior
knowledge
regarding
their
values.
As is
typically
the
case,
we
know
nothing
about
the
values
for
\(\beta_0\)
and
\(\beta_1\).
These
parameters
are
allowed
to
take
any
value,
so
long
as it
is a
real
number.
Since
all
values
are
allowable,
we can
assume
a flat
distribution
where
any
value
has an
equally
likely
probability.
This
value
of
this
constant
probability
is not
necessary
for
our
calculation
and is
ignored.
For a
set of
\(k\)
single-cell
measurements,
we can
write
the
posterior
probability
distribution
stated
in
Eq.~\ref{eq:bayes_surv_prob}
as
\begin{equation}
g(\beta_0, \beta_1\,\vert\, N_c, s) = \prod\limits_{i=1}^n\left({1 \over 1 + e^{-\beta_0 - \beta_1 N_c^{(i)}}}\right)^{s^{(i)}}\left(1 - {1 \over 1 + e^{-\beta_0 - \beta_1 N_c^{(i)}}}\right)^{1 - s^{(i)}}
\label{eq:known_nc_post}\end{equation}

~~~~Implicitly
stated
in
Eq.~\ref{eq:known_nc_post}
is
absolute
knowledge
of the
channel
copy
number
\(N_c\).
However,
as is
described
in
\emph{Standard
Candle
Calibration},
we
must
convert
from a
measured
areal
sfGFP
intensity
\(I_A\)
to a
effective
channel
copy
number,
\begin{equation}
N_c = {I_A \tilde{\langle A \rangle} \over \tilde{\alpha}},
\label{eq:standard_candle}\end{equation}
where
\(\tilde{\langle A \rangle}\)
is the
average
cell
area
of the
standard
candle
strain
and
\(\tilde{\alpha}\)
is the
most-likely
value
for
the
calibration
factor
between
arbitrary
units
and
protein
copy
number.
In
\emph{Standard
Candle
Calibration},
we
detailed
a
process
for
generating
an
estimate
for
the
most-likely
value
of
\(\tilde{\langle A \rangle}\)
and
\(\tilde{\alpha}\).
Given
these
estimates,
we can
include
an
informative
prior
for
each
value.
From
the
Markov
chain
Monte
Carlo
samples
shown
in
Fig.~\ref{fig:posterior_samples},
the
posterior
distribution
for
each
parameter
is
approximately
Gaussian.
By
approximating
them
as
Gaussian
distributions,
we can
assign
an
informative
prior
for
each
as
\begin{equation}
g(\alpha\,\vert\,\tilde{\alpha}, \tilde{\sigma}_\alpha) \propto {1 \over \tilde{\sigma}_\alpha^k}\prod\limits_{i=1}^k\exp\left[-{(\alpha_i - \tilde{\alpha})^2 \over  2\tilde{\sigma}_\alpha^2}\right]
\label{eq:alpha_prior}\end{equation}
for
the
calibration
factor
for
each
cell
and
\begin{equation}
g(\langle A \rangle\,\vert\,\tilde{\langle A \rangle},\tilde{\sigma}_{\langle A \rangle}) = {1 \over \tilde{\sigma}_{\langle A \rangle}^k}\prod\limits_{i=1}^k\exp\left[-{(\langle A \rangle_i - \tilde{\langle A \rangle})^2 \over 2\tilde{\sigma}_{\langle A \rangle}^2}\right],
\label{eq:area_prior}\end{equation}
where
\(\tilde{\sigma}_\alpha\)
and
\(\tilde{\sigma}_{\langle A \rangle}\)
represent
the
variance
from
approximating
each
posterior
as a
Gaussian.
The
proportionality
for
each
prior
arises
from
the
neglecting
of
normalization
constants
for
notational
convenience.

~~~~Given
Eq.~\ref{eq:bernoulli_likelihood}
through
Eq.~\ref{eq:area_prior},
the
complete
posterior
distribution
for
estimating
the
most
likely
values
of
\(\beta_0\)
and
\(\beta_1\)
can be
written
as
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
g(\beta_0, &\beta_1\,\vert\,[I_A, s],\tilde{\langle A \rangle}, \tilde{\sigma}_{\langle A \rangle}, \tilde{\alpha}, \tilde{\sigma}_\alpha) \propto{1 \over (\tilde{\sigma}_\alpha\tilde{\sigma}_{\langle A \rangle})^k}\prod\limits_{i=1}^k\left(1 + \exp\left[-\beta_0 - \beta_1 {{I_A}_i \langle A \rangle_i \over \alpha_i}\right]\right)^{-s_i}\,\times\,\\
&\left(1 - \left(1 + \exp\left[-\beta_0 - \beta_1 {{I_A}_i\langle A \rangle_i \over \alpha_i}\right]\right)^{-1}\right)^{1 - s_i}
\exp\left[-{(\langle A \rangle_i - \tilde{\langle A \rangle})^2 \over 2\tilde{\sigma}_{\langle A \rangle}} - {(\alpha_i - \tilde{\alpha})^2\over 2\tilde{\sigma}_\alpha^2}\right]
\end{aligned}.
\label{eq:logistic_posterior}\end{equation}

As
this
posterior
distribution
is not
solvable
analytically,
we
used
Markov
chain
Monte
Carlo
to
draw
samples
out of
this
distribution,
using
the
log of
the
effective
channel
number
as
described
in the
main
text.
The
posterior
distributions
for
\(\beta_0\)
and
\(\beta_1\)
for
both
slow
and
fast
shock
rate
data
can be
seen
in

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{A
Bayesian
interpretation
of
\(\beta_0\)
and
\(\beta_1\)}{A Bayesian interpretation of \textbackslash{}beta\_0 and \textbackslash{}beta\_1}}\label{a-bayesian-interpretation-of-beta_0-and-beta_1}

The
assumption
of a
linear
relationship
between
the
log-odds
of
survival
and
the
predictor
variable
\(N_c\)
appears
to be
arbitrary
and is
presented
without
justification.
However,
this
relationship
is
directly
connected
to the
manner
in
which
Bayes'
theorem
updates
the
posterior
probability
distribution
upon
the
observation
of new
data.
In
following
section,
we
will
demonstrate
this
connection
using
the
relationship
between
survival
and
channel
copy
number.
However,
this
description
is
general
and
can be
applied
to any
logistic
regression
model
so
long
as the
response
variable
is
binary.
This
connection
was
shown
briefly
by
Allen
Downey
in
2014
and
has
been
expanded
upon
in
this
work
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-downey2014}{54}).

~~~~The
probability
of
observing
a
survival
event
\(s\)
given
a
measurement
of
\(N_c\)
channels
can be
stated
using
Bayes'
theorem
as
\begin{equation}
g(s\,\vert\, N_c) = {f(N_c\,\vert\, s)g(s) \over f(N_c)}.
\label{eq:survival_bayes}\end{equation}
where
\(g\)
and
\(f\)
represent
probability
density
functions
over
parameters
and
data
respectively.
The
posterior
distribution
\(g(s\,\vert\, N_c)\)
is the
quantity
of
interest
and
implicitly
related
to the
probability
of
survival.
The
likelihood
\(g(N_c\,\vert\, s)\)
tells
us the
probability
of
observing
\(N_c\)
channels
in
this
cell
given
that
it
survives.
The
quantity
\(g(s)\)
captures
all
\emph{a
priori}
knowledge
we
have
regarding
the
probability
of
this
cell
surviving
and
the
denominator
\(f(N_c)\)
tells
us the
converse
-- the
probability
of
observing
\(N_c\)
cells
irrespective
of the
survival
outcome.

~~~~Proper
calculation
of
Eq.~\ref{eq:survival_bayes}
requires
that
we
have
knowledge
of
\(f(N_c)\),
which
is
difficult
to
estimate.
While
we are
able
to
give
appropriate
bounds
on
this
term,
such
as a
requirement
of
positivity
and
some
knowledge
of the
maximum
membrane
packing
density,
it is
not so
obvious
to
determine
the
distribution
between
these
bounds.
Given
this
difficulty,
it's
easier
to
compute
the
odds
of
survival
\(\mathcal{O}(s\,\vert\, N_c)\),
the
probability
of
survival
\(s\)
relative
to
death
\(d\),
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{O}(s\,\vert\, N_c) = {g(s\,\vert\,N_c) \over g(d\,\vert\, N_c)} = {f(N_c\,\vert\, s)g(s) \over f(N_c\,\vert\,d)g(d)},
\label{eq:odds_definition}\end{equation}
where
\(f(N_c)\)
is
cancelled.
The
only
stipulation
on the
possible
value
of the
odds
is
that
it
must
be a
positive
value.
As we
would
like
to
equally
weigh
odds
less
than
one as
those
of
several
hundred
or
thousand,
it is
more
convenient
to
compute
the
log-odds,
given
as
\begin{equation}
\log \mathcal{O}(s\,\vert\,N_c)= \log {g(s) \over g(d)} + \log {f(N_c \,\vert\, s )\over f(N_c\,\vert\, d)}.
\label{eq:log_odds}\end{equation}
Computing
the
log-transform
reveals
two
interesting
quantities.
The
first
term
is the
ratio
of the
priors
and
tells
us the
\emph{a
priori}
knowledge
of the
odds
of
survival
irrespective
of the
number
of
channels.
As we
have
no
reason
to
think
that
survival
is
more
likely
than
death,
this
ratio
goes
to
unity.
The
second
term
is the
log
likelihood
ratio
and
tells
us how
likely
we are
to
observe
a
given
channel
copy
number
\(N_c\)
given
the
cell
survives
relative
to
when
it
dies.

~~~~For
each
channel
copy
number,
we can
evaluate
Eq.~\ref{eq:log_odds}
to
measure
the
log-odds
of
survival.
If we
start
with
zero
channels
per
cell,
we can
write
the
log-odds
of
survival
as
\begin{equation}
\log \mathcal{O}(s\,\vert\,N_c=0) = \log {g(s) \over g(d)} + \log {f(N_c=0\,\vert\, s) \over f(N_c=0\,\vert\, d)}.
\label{eq:nc_0}\end{equation}
For a
channel
copy
number
of
one,
the
odds
of
survival
is
\begin{equation}
\log \mathcal{O}(s\,\vert\,N_c=1) = \log{g(s) \over g(d)} + \log{f(N_c=1\,\vert\, s) \over f(N_c=1\,\vert\, d)}.
\label{eq:nc_1}\end{equation}
In
both
Eq.~\ref{eq:nc_0}
and
Eq.~\ref{eq:nc_1},
the
log of
our
\emph{a
priori}
knowledge
of
survival
versus
death
remains.
The
only
factor
that
is
changing
is log
likelihood
ratio.
We can
be
more
general
in our
language
and
say
that
the
log-odds
of
survival
is
increased
by the
difference
in the
log-odds
conveyed
by
addition
of a
single
channel.
We can
rewrite
the
log
likelihood
ratio
in a
more
general
form
as
\begin{equation}
\log {f(N_c\, \vert\, s) \over f(N_c\,\vert\, d)} = \log{f(N_c = 0\,\vert\,s) \over f(N_c=0\,\vert\, d)} + N_c \left[\log{f(N_c=1 \,\vert\,s) \over f(N_c=1\,\vert\, d)} - \log{f(N_c=0\,\vert\, s) \over f(N_c=0\,\vert\, d)}\right],
\label{eq:generalized_LLR}\end{equation}
where
we are
now
only
considering
the
case
in
which
\(N_c \in [0, 1]\).
The
bracketed
term
in
Eq.~\ref{eq:generalized_LLR}
is the
log of
the
odds
of
survival
given
a
single
channel
relative
to the
odds
of
survival
given
no
channels.
Mathematically,
this
odds-ratio
can be
expressed
as
\begin{equation}
\log\mathcal{OR}_{N_c}(s) = \log{{f(N_c=1\,\vert\,s)g(s)\over f(N_c=1\,\vert\,d)g(d)}\over {f(N_c=0\,\vert\,s)g(s)\over f(N_c=0\,\vert\,d)g(d)}} = \log{f(N_c=1\,\vert\,s) \over f(N_c=1\,\vert\,d)} - \log{f(N_c=0\,\vert\,s)\over f(N_c=0\,\vert\,d)} .
\label{eq:odds_ratio}\end{equation}
Eq.~\ref{eq:odds_ratio}
is
mathematically
equivalent
to the
bracketed
term
shown
in
Eq.~\ref{eq:generalized_LLR}.

~~~~We
can
now
begin
to
staple
these
pieces
together
to
arrive
at an
expression
for
the
log
odds
of
survival.
Combining
Eq.~\ref{eq:generalized_LLR}
with
Eq.~\ref{eq:log_odds}
yields
\begin{equation}
\log \mathcal{O}(s\,\vert\,N_c) = \log{g(s) \over g(d)} + \log {f(N_c=0\,\vert\, s) \over f(N_c=0\,\vert\, d)} + N_c\left[{f(N_c=1\,\vert\,s)\over f(N_c=1\,\vert\,d)} - \log{f(N_c=0\,\vert\,s) \over f(N_c=0\,\vert\,d)}\right].
\label{eq:combined_v1}\end{equation}
Using
our
knowledge
that
the
bracketed
term
is the
log
odds-ratio
and
the
first
two
times
represents
the
log-odds
of
survival
with
\(N_c=0\),
we
conclude
with
\begin{equation}
\log\mathcal{O}(s\,\vert\,N_c) = \log \mathcal{O}(s\,\vert\,N_c=0) + N_c \log \mathcal{OR}_{N_c}(s).
\label{eq:bayesian_logit}\end{equation}
This
result
can be
directly
compared
to Eq.
1
presented
in the
main
text,
\begin{equation}
\log {p_s \over 1 - p_s} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 N_c,
\end{equation}
which
allows
for an
interpretation
of the
seemingly
arbitrary
coefficients
\(\beta_0\)
and
\(\beta_1\).
The
intercept
term,
\(\beta_0\),
captures
the
log-odds
of
survival
with
no
MscL
channels.
The
slope,
\(\beta_1\),
describes
the
log
odds-ratio
of
survival
which
a
single
channel
relative
to the
odds
of
survival
with
no
channels
at
all.
While
we
have
examined
this
considering
only
two
possible
channel
copy
numbers
(\(1\)
and
\(0\)),
the
relationship
between
them
is
linear.
We can
therefore
generalize
this
for
any
MscL
copy
number
as the
increase
in the
log-odds
of
survival
is
constant
for
addition
of a
single
channel.

\subsubsection{Other
properties
as
predictor
variables}\label{other-properties-as-predictor-variables}

~~~~
The
previous
two
sections
discuss
in
detail
the
logic
and
practice
behind
the
application
of
logistic
regression
to
cell
survival
data
using
only
the
effective
channel
copy
number
as the
predictor
of
survival.
However,
there
are a
variety
of
properties
that
could
rightly
be
used
as
predictor
variables,
such
as
cell
area
and
shock
rate.
As is
stipulated
in our
standard
candle
calibration,
there
should
be no
correlation
between
survival
and
cell
area.
Fig.~\ref{fig:alternative_predictor_variables}A
and B
show
the
logistic
regression
performed
on the
cell
area.
We see
for
both
slow
and
fast
shock
groups,there
is
little
change
in
survival
probability
with
changing
cell
area
and
the
wide
credible
regions
allow
for
both
positive
and
negative
correlation
between
survival
and
area.
The
appearance
of a
bottle
neck
in the
notably
wide
credible
regions
is a
result
of a
large
fraction
of the
measurements
being
tightly
distributed
about
a mean
value.
Fig.~\ref{fig:alternative_predictor_variables}C
shows
the
predicted
survival
probability
as a
function
of the
the
shock
rate.
There
is a
slight
decrease
in
survivability
as a
function
of
increasing
shock
rate,
however
the
width
of the
credible
region
allows
for
slightly
positive
or
slightly
negative
correlation.
While
we
have
presented
logistic
regression
in
this
section
as a
one-dimensional
method,
Eq.~\ref{eq:logit}
can be
generalized
to
\(n\)
predictor
variables
\(x\)
as
\begin{equation}
\log {p_s \over 1 - p_s} = \beta_0 + \sum\limits_{i}^n \beta_ix_i.
\label{eq:generalized_logit}\end{equation}
Using
this
generalization,
we can
use
both
shock
rate
and
the
effective
channel
copy
number
as
predictor
variables.
The
resulting
two-dimensional
surface
of
survival
probability
is
shown
in
Fig.~\ref{fig:alternative_predictor_variables}D.
As is
suggested
by
Fig.~\ref{fig:alternative_predictor_variables}C,
the
magnitude
of
change
in
survivability
as the
shock
rate
is
increased
is
smaller
than
that
along
increasing
channel
copy
number,
supporting
our
conclusion
that
for
MscL
alone,
the
copy
number
is the
most
important
variable
in
determining
survival.
