  abstract = {The availability of complete genomic sequences and technologies that allow comprehensive analysis of global expression profiles of messenger RNA have greatly expanded our ability to monitor the internal state of a cell. Yet biological systems ultimately need to be explained in terms of the activity, regulation and modification of proteins--and the ubiquitous occurrence of post-transcriptional regulation makes mRNA an imperfect proxy for such information. To facilitate global protein analyses, we have created a Saccharomyces cerevisiae fusion library where each open reading frame is tagged with a high-affinity epitope and expressed from its natural chromosomal location. Through immunodetection of the common tag, we obtain a census of proteins expressed during log-phase growth and measurements of their absolute levels. We find that about 80\% of the proteome is expressed during normal growth conditions, and, using additional sequence information, we systematically identify misannotated genes. The abundance of proteins ranges from fewer than 50 to more than 10(6) molecules per cell. Many of these molecules, including essential proteins and most transcription factors, are present at levels that are not readily detectable by other proteomic techniques nor predictable by mRNA levels or codon bias measurements.},

  abstract = {AIMS: The aim was to evaluate the biosynthetic requirements for the repair of sublethal membrane damages in Escherichia coli cells after exposure to pulsed electric fields (PEF). METHODS AND RESULTS: The partial loss of the barrier and homeostatic functions of the cytoplasmic membrane was examined by adding sodium chloride to the recovery media. More than 4 log10 cycles of survivors were sublethally injured after PEF. Repair of such sublethal membrane damages occurred when survivors to PEF were incubated in peptone water for 2 h. Two different types of sublethally injured cells were detected. Whereas a small proportion ($<$5\%) repaired after PEF in less than 2 min, the repair of the remaining 95\% injured cells lasted 2 h and was dependent on biosynthetic requirements. The addition of inhibitors such as chloramphenicol, cerulenin, penicillin G, rifampicin and sodium azide to the liquid repair medium showed that the repair required energy and lipid synthesis, and was not dependent on protein, peptidoglican or RNA synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Cell survival after PEF is dependent on the repair of the cytoplasmic membrane. Requirement of lipid synthesis for the repair of sublethally injured cells confirms that the cytoplasmic membrane is a target directly involved in the mechanism of inactivation by PEF. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Knowledge about the damages inflicted by PEF might help in the design of more efficient treatments.},

  abstract = {We have developed a new technique to study the oligomeric state of proteins in solution. OCAM or Oligomer Characterization by Addition of Mass counts protein subunits by selectively shaving a protein mass tag added to a protein subunit via a short peptide linker. Cleavage of each mass tag reduces the total mass of the protein complex by a fixed amount. By performing limited proteolysis and separating the reaction products by size on a blue native PAGE gel, a ladder of reaction products corresponding to the number of subunits can be resolved. The pattern of bands may be used to distinguish the presence of a single homo-oligomer from a mixture of oligomeric states. We have applied OCAM to study the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) and find that these proteins can exist in multiple oligomeric states ranging from tetramers up to possible hexamers. Our results demonstrate the existence of oligomeric forms of MscL not yet observed by X-ray crystallography or other techniques and that in some cases a single type of MscL subunit can assemble as a mixture of oligomeric states.},

Such heterogeneity can be essential for many biological processes and is conjectured to arise from stochasticity, or noise, in gene expression. We constructed strains of Escherichia coli that enable detection of noise and discrimination between the two mechanisms by which it is generated. Both stochasticity inherent in the biochemical process of gene expression (intrinsic noise) and fluctuations in other cellular components (extrinsic noise) contribute substantially to overall variation. Transcription rate, regulatory dynamics, and genetic factors control the amplitude of noise. These results establish a quantitative foundation for modeling noise in genetic networks and reveal how low intracellular copy numbers of molecules can fundamentally limit the precision of gene regulation.},

Noise, far from just a nuisance, has begun to be appreciated for its essential role in key cellular activities. Noise functions in both microbial and eukaryotic cells, in multicellular development, and in evolution. It enables coordination of gene expression across large regulons, as well as probabilistic differentiation strategies that function across cell populations. At the longest timescales, noise may facilitate evolutionary transitions. Here we review examples and emerging principles that connect noise, the architecture of the gene circuits in which it is present, and the biological functions it enables.

  abstract = {Physical expansion associated with the opening of a tension-sensitive channel has the same meaning as gating charge for a voltage-gated channel. Despite increasing evidence for the open-state conformation of MscL, the energetic description of its complex gating remains incomplete. The previously estimated in-plane expansion of MscL is considerably smaller than predicted by molecular models. To resolve this discrepancy, we conducted a systematic study of currents and dose-response curves for wild-type MscL in Escherichia coli giant spheroplasts. Using the all-point histogram method and calibrating tension against the threshold for the small mechanosensitive channel (MscS) in each patch, we found that the distribution of channels among the subconducting states is significantly less dependent on tension than the distribution between the closed and conducting states. At -20 mV, all substates together occupy approximately 30\% of the open time and reduce the mean integral current by approximately 6\%, essentially independent of tension or P(o). This is consistent with the gating scheme in which the major rate-limiting step is the transition between the closed state and a low-conducting substate, and validates both the use of the integral current as a measure of P(o), and treatment of dose-response curves in the two-state approximation. The apparent energy and area differences between the states deltaE and deltaA, extracted from 29 independent dose-response curves, varied in a linearly correlated manner whereas the midpoint tension stayed at approximately 10.4 mN/m. Statistical modeling suggests slight variability of gating parameters among channels in each patch, causing a strong reduction and correlated spread of apparent deltaE and deltaA. The slope of initial parts of activation curves, with a few channels being active, gave estimates of deltaE = 51 +/- 13 kT and deltaA = 20.4 +/- 4.8 nm(2), the latter being consistent with structural models of MscL, which predict deltaA = 23 nm(2).},

  abstract = {Mechanosensitive channels sense elevated membrane tension that arises from rapid water influx occurring when cells move from high to low osmolarity environments (hypoosmotic shock). These non-specific channels in the cytoplasmic membrane release osmotically-active solutes and ions. The two major mechanosensitive channels in Escherichia coli are MscL and MscS. Deletion of both proteins severely compromises survival of hypoosmotic shock. However, like many bacteria, E. coli cells possess other MscS-type genes (kefA, ybdG, ybiO, yjeP and ynaI). Two homologs, MscK (kefA) and YbdG, have been characterized as mechanosensitive channels that play minor roles in maintaining cell integrity. Additional channel openings are occasionally observed in patches derived from mutants lacking MscS, MscK and MscL. Due to their rare occurrence, little is known about these extra pressure-induced currents or their genetic origins. Here we complete the identification of the remaining E. coli mechanosensitive channels YnaI, YbiO and YjeP. The latter is the major component of the previously described MscM activity (\textasciitilde{}300 pS), while YnaI (\textasciitilde{}100 pS) and YbiO (\textasciitilde{}1000 pS) were previously unknown. Expression of native YbiO is NaCl-specific and RpoS-dependent. A Delta7 strain was created with all seven E. coli mechanosensitive channel genes deleted. High level expression of YnaI, YbiO or YjeP proteins from a multicopy plasmid in the Delta7 strain (MJFGH) leads to substantial protection against hypoosmotic shock. Purified homologs exhibit high molecular masses that are consistent with heptameric assemblies. This work reveals novel mechanosensitive channels and discusses the regulation of their expression in the context of possible additional functions.},

The number and brightness (N\&B) analysis, namely, the use of the ratio between the variance and the average intensity to obtain the brightness of molecules, is extended to the cross-variance of the intensity fluctuations in two channels. We apply the cross-variance method to determine the stoichiometry of complexes containing paxillin and vinculin or focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in disassembling adhesions in mouse embryo fibroblasts expressing FAK, vinculin, and paxillin-tagged with EGFP and mCherry. We found no complexes of these proteins in the cytoplasm away from the adhesions. However, at the adhesions, large aggregates leave, forming a hole, during their disassembly. This hole shows cross-correlation between FAK and paxillin and vinculin and paxillin. From the amplitude of the correlated fluctuations we determine the composition of the aggregates leaving the adhesions. These aggregates disassemble rapidly in the cytoplasm because large complexes are found only in very close proximity to the adhesions or at their borders.},

  abstract = {Mechanosensitive ion channels play a critical role in transducing physical stresses at the cell membrane into an electrochemical response. The MscL family of large-conductance mechanosensitive channels is widely distributed among prokaryotes and may participate in the regulation of osmotic pressure changes within the cell. In an effort to better understand the structural basis for the function of these channels, the structure of the MscL homolog from Mycobacterium tuberculosis was determined by x-ray crystallography to 3.5 angstroms resolution. This channel is organized as a homopentamer, with each subunit containing two transmembrane alpha helices and a third cytoplasmic alpha helix. From the extracellular side, a water-filled opening approximately 18 angstroms in diameter leads into a pore lined with hydrophilic residues which narrows at the cytoplasmic side to an occluded hydrophobic apex that may act as the channel gate. This structure may serve as a model for other mechanosensitive channels, as well as the broader class of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels exemplified by the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.},

  abstract = {Multiconformation membrane proteins are mechanosensitive (MS) if their conformations displace different bilayer areas. Might MS closed-closed transitions serve as tension buffers, that is, as membrane "spandex"? While bilayer expansion is effectively instantaneous, transitions of bilayer-embedded MS proteins are stochastic (thermally activated) so spandex kinetics would be critical. Here we model generic two-state (contracted/expanded) stochastic spandexes inspired by known bacterial osmovalves (MscL, MscS) then suggest experimental approaches to test for spandex-like behaviors in these proteins. Modeling shows: 1), spandex kinetics depend on the transition state location along an area reaction coordinate; 2), increasing membrane concentration of a spandex right-shifts its midpoint (= tension-Boltzmann); 3), spandexes with midpoints below the activating tension of an osmovalve could optimize osmovalve deployment (required: large midpoint, barrier near the expanded state); 4), spandexes could damp bilayer tension excursions (required: midpoint at target tension, and for speed, barrier halfway between the contracted and expanded states; the larger the spandex Delta-area, the more precise the maintenance of target tension; higher spandex concentrations damp larger amplitude strain fluctuations). One spandex species could not excel as both first line of defense for osmovalve partners and tension damper. Possible interactions among MS closed-closed and closed-open transitions are discussed for MscS- and MscL-like proteins.},

  abstract = {For most cells, a sudden decrease in external osmolarity results in fast water influx that can burst the cell. To survive, cells rely on the passive response of mechanosensitive channels, which open under increased membrane tension and allow the release of cytoplasmic solutes and water. Although the gating and the molecular structure of mechanosensitive channels found in Escherichia coli have been extensively studied, the overall dynamics of the whole cellular response remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize E. coli's passive response to a sudden hypoosmotic shock (downshock) on a single-cell level. We show that initial fast volume expansion is followed by a slow volume recovery that can end below the initial value. Similar response patterns were observed at downshocks of a wide range of magnitudes. Although wild-type cells adapted to osmotic downshocks and resumed growing, cells of a double-mutant ([Formula: see text]) strain expanded, but failed to fully recover, often lysing or not resuming growth at high osmotic downshocks. We propose a theoretical model to explain our observations by simulating mechanosensitive channels opening, and subsequent solute efflux and water flux. The model illustrates how solute efflux, driven by mechanical pressure and solute chemical potential, competes with water influx to reduce cellular osmotic pressure and allow volume recovery. Our work highlights the vital role of mechanosensation in bacterial survival.},

  abstract = {Microorganisms adapt to osmotic downshifts by releasing small osmolytes through mechanosensitive (MS) channels. We want to understand how the small mechanosensitive channel's (MscS) activation and inactivation, both driven by membrane tension, optimize survival in varying hypoosmotic shock situations. By measuring light scattering with a stopped-flow device, we estimate bacterial swelling time as 30-50 ms. A partial solute equilibration follows within 150-200 ms, during which optical responses from cells with WT MscS deviate from those lacking MS channels. MscS opening rates estimated in patch clamp show the channels readily respond to tensions below the lytic limit with a time course faster than 20 ms and close promptly upon tension release. To address the role of the tension-insensitive inactivated state in vivo, we applied short, long, and two-step osmotic shock protocols to WT, noninactivating G113A, and fast-inactivating D62N mutants. WT and G113A showed a comparable survival in short 1 min 800 mOsm downshock experiments, but G113A was at a disadvantage under a long 60 min shock. Preshocking cells carrying WT MscS for 15 s to 15 min with a 200 mOsm downshift did not sensitize them to the final 500 mOsm drop in osmolarity of the second step. However, these two-step shocks induced death in D62N more than just a one-step 700 mOsm downshift. We conclude MscS is able to activate and exude osmolytes faster than lytic pressure builds inside the cell under abrupt shock. During prolonged shocks, gradual inactivation prevents continuous channel activity and assists recovery. Slow kinetics of inactivation in WT MscS ensures that mild shocks do not inactivate the entire population, leaving some protection should conditions worsen.},

  abstract = {MscL is a channel found in bacterial plasma membranes that opens a large pore in response to mechanical stress. Here we demonstrate that some mutations within this channel protein (K31D and K31E) evoke a cellular phenotype in which the growth rate is severely depressed. Increasing the osmolarity of the growth medium partially rescues this "slowed growth" phenotype and decreases an abnormal cytosolic potassium loss observed in cells expressing the mutants. In addition, upon sudden decrease in osmolarity (osmotic downshock) more cytoplasmic potassium is released from cells expressing the mutants than cells expressing wild-type MscL. After osmotic downshock, all cells remained viable; hence, the differences in potassium efflux observed are not due to cell lysis but instead appear to be an exaggeration of the normal response to this sudden change in environmental osmolarity. Patch clamp studies in native bacterial membranes substantiate the hypothesis that these mutant channels are more sensitive to mechanical stresses, especially at voltages approaching those estimated for bacterial membrane potentials. These data are consistent with a crucial role for MscL in the adaptation to large osmotic downshock and suggest that if the normally tight regulation of MscL gating is disrupted, cell growth can be severely inhibited.},

  abstract = {MscL is a channel that opens a large pore in the Escherichia coli cytoplasmic membrane in response to mechanical stress. Previously, we highly enriched the MscL protein by using patch clamp as a functional assay and cloned the corresponding gene. The predicted protein contains a largely hydrophobic core spanning two-thirds of the molecule and a more hydrophilic carboxyl terminal tail. Because MscL had no homology to characterized proteins, it was impossible to predict functional regions of the protein by simple inspection. Here, by mutagenesis, we have searched for functionally important regions of this molecule. We show that a short deletion from the amino terminus (3 amino acids), and a larger deletion of 27 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of this protein, had little if any effect in channel properties. We have thus narrowed the search of the core mechanosensitive mechanism to 106 residues of this 136-amino acid protein. In contrast, single residue substitutions of a lysine in the putative first transmembrane domain or a glutamine in the periplasmic loop caused pronounced shifts in the mechano-sensitivity curves and/or large changes in the kinetics of channel gating, suggesting that the conformational structure in these regions is critical for normal mechanosensitive channel gating.},

  abstract = {sigmaS (RpoS) is the master regulator of the general stress response in Escherichia coli. Several stresses increase cellular sigmaS levels by inhibiting proteolysis of sigmaS, which under non-stress conditions is a highly unstable protein. For this ClpXP-dependent degradation, the response regulator RssB acts as a recognition factor, with RssB affinity for sigmaS being modulated by phosphorylation. Here, we demonstrate that RssB can also act like an anti-sigma factor for sigmaS in vivo, i.e. RssB can inhibit the expression of sigmaS-dependent genes in the presence of high sigmaS levels. This becomes apparent when (i) the cellular RssB/sigmaS ratio is at least somewhat elevated and (ii) proteolysis is reduced (for example in stationary phase) or eliminated (for example in a clpP mutant). Two modes of inhibition of sigmaS by RssB can be distinguished. The 'catalytic' mode is observed in stationary phase cells with a substoichiometric RssB/sigmaS ratio, requires ClpP and therefore probably corresponds to sequestering of sigmaS to Clp protease (even though sigmaS is not degraded). The 'stoichiometric' mode occurs in clpP mutant cells upon overproduction of RssB to levels that are equal to those of sigmaS, and therefore probably involves binary complex formation between RssB and sigmaS. We also show that, under standard laboratory conditions, the cellular level of RssB is more than 20-fold lower than that of sigmaS and is not significantly controlled by stresses that upregulate sigmaS. We therefore propose that antisigma factor activity of RssB may play a role under not yet identified growth conditions (which may result in RssB induction), or that RssB is a former antisigma factor that during evolution was recruited to serve as a recognition factor for proteolysis.},

The total observed intracellular metabolite pool was approximately 300 mM. A small number of metabolites dominate the metabolome on a molar basis, with glutamate being the most abundant. Metabolite concentration exceeds K(m) for most substrate-enzyme pairs. An exception is lower glycolysis, where concentrations of intermediates are near the K(m) of their consuming enzymes and all reactions are near equilibrium. This may facilitate efficient flux reversibility given thermodynamic and osmotic constraints. The data and analyses presented here highlight the ability to identify organizing metabolic principles from systems-level absolute metabolite concentration data.},

  abstract = {The degradation of the RpoS (sigmaS) subunit of RNA polymerase in Escherichia coli is a prime example of regulated proteolysis in prokaryotes. RpoS turnover depends on ClpXP protease, the response regulator RssB, and a hitherto uncharacterized "turnover element" within RpoS itself. Here we localize the turnover element to a small element (around the crucial amino acid lysine-173) directly downstream of the promoter-recognizing region 2.4 in RpoS. Its sequence as well as its location identify the turnover element as a unique proteolysis-promoting motif. This element is shown to be a site of interaction with RssB. Thus, RssB is functionally unique among response regulators as a direct recognition factor in ClpXP-dependent RpoS proteolysis. Binding of RssB to RpoS is stimulated by phosphorylation of the RssB receiver domain, suggesting that environmental stress affects RpoS proteolysis by modulating RssB affinity for RpoS. Initial evidence indicates that lysine-173 in RpoS, besides being essential of RpoS proteolysis, may play a role in promoter recognition. Thus the same region in RpoS is crucial for proteolysis as well as for activity as a transcription factor.},

  doi = {10.1128/9781555816452.ch14},
  abstract = {This chapter provides an overview on the role of bacterial channels in cell physiology. The proposed role of mechanosensitive (MS) channels is the rapid and nonspecific release of solutes from the cell in response to the generation of excessive turgor pressure. This model has now been tested and verified for E. coli. In most bacterial cells Cl- ions have not been predicted to have significant roles in cell physiology. In some halophilic bacteria Cl- is accumulated to provide salt balance during growth in very high salt concentrations. The aquaglyceroporins are pores that allow the permeation of water and small linear polyhydric molecules through the bacterial membrane. The cell faces two types of problems that relate to ammonium ions. First, there is the need to scavenge for ammonium when the concentration in the environment is low. Second, cells growing on broth may encounter a surfeit of cytoplasmic ammonium ions arising from the deamination of amino acids. In a wide range of bacterial genera the genes for AmtB and GlnK exist as an operon, and recent work suggests that the former is a pore that is used by cells to accelerate the passage of ammonium ions across the membrane and that GlnK is a specific component of the nitrogen-regulatory circuit that controls its activity. The increased understanding of mechanistic aspects of the channel selectivity and gating has advanced rapidly, but an appreciation of the role of channels in cell physiology lags well behind.},

  abstract = {The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Tb-MscL) was subjected to cysteine-scanning mutagenesis at several residues in the M1 region. The V15C channel displayed disulfide crosslinking in air, but not in the presence of 100 mM $\beta$-mercaptoethanol. In single-channel experiments, the V15C channel was more sensitive to tension than was wild-type Tb-MscL. In air, Tb-MscL V15C occasionally displayed signature-events: at constant tension, there was first a sojourn in the highest conductance open state, then a series of transitions to substates. During a signature-event, these transitions do not appear to be reversible. Some sojourns in the lower conductance states lasted for $\geq$100 s. These signature-events were abolished by 100 mM $\beta$-mercaptoethanol and did not occur in a cysteineless gain-of-function mutant, suggesting that the signature-events represent disulfide crosslinking between channel subunits. We conclude that the crosslinking occurs during an open state during asymmetric sojourns that bring the $\alpha$-carbons of adjacent 15C side chains within 3.6\textendash{}6.8 \AA. Such asymmetric structures must be considered in models of TB-MscL gating.},

  abstract = {Bacteria are subjected to a host of different environmental stresses. One such insult occurs when cells encounter changes in the osmolarity of the surrounding media resulting in an osmotic shock. In recent years, a great deal has been learned about mechanosensitive (MS) channels which are thought to provide osmoprotection in these circumstances by opening emergency release valves in response to membrane tension. However, even the most elementary physiological parameters such as the number of MS channels per cell, how MS channel expression levels influence the physiological response of the cells, and how this mean number of channels varies from cell to cell remain unanswered. In this paper, we make a detailed quantitative study of the expression of the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) in different media and at various stages in the growth history of bacterial cultures. Using both quantitative fluorescence microscopy and quantitative Western blots our study complements earlier electrophysiology-based estimates and results in the following key insights: i) the mean number of channels per cell is much higher than previously estimated, ii) measurement of the single-cell distributions of such channels reveals marked variability from cell to cell and iii) the mean number of channels varies under different environmental conditions. The regulation of MscL expression displays rich behaviors that depend strongly on culturing conditions and stress factors, which may give clues to the physiological role of MscL. The number of stressinduced MscL channels and the associated variability have far reaching implications for the in vivo response of the channels and for modeling of this response. As shown by numerous biophysical models, both the number of such channels and their variability can impact many physiological processes including osmoprotection, channel gating probability, and channel clustering.},

To that end, we present a general theory of allosteric transcriptional regulation using the Monod-WymanChangeux model. We rigorously test this model using the ubiquitous simple repression motif in bacteria by first predicting the behavior of strains that span a large range of repressor copy numbers and DNA binding strengths and then constructing and measuring their response. Our model not only accurately captures the induction profiles of these strains, but also enables us to derive analytic expressions for key properties such as the dynamic range and [EC50]. Finally, we derive an expression for the free energy of allosteric repressors that enables us to collapse our experimental data onto a single master curve that captures the diverse phenomenology of the induction profiles.},

  doi = {10.1128/AEM.02203-17},
  abstract = {Francisella tularensis subsp. holarctica is found in North America and much of Europe and causes the disease tularemia in humans and animals. An aquatic cycle has been described for this subspecies, which has caused waterborne outbreaks of tularemia in at least 10 countries. In this study, we sought to identify the mechanosensitive channel(s) required for the bacterium to survive the transition from mammalian hosts to freshwater, which is likely essential for the transmission of the bacterium between susceptible hosts. A single 165-amino-acid MscS-type mechanosensitive channel (FtMscS) was found to protect F. tularensis subsp. holarctica from hypoosmotic shock, despite lacking much of the cytoplasmic vestibule domain found in well-characterized MscS proteins from other organisms. The deletion of this channel did not affect virulence within the mammalian host; however, FtMscS was required to survive the transition from the host niche to freshwater. The deletion of FtMscS did not alter the sensitivity of F. tularensis subsp. holarctica to detergents, H2O2, or antibiotics, suggesting that the role of FtMscS is specific to protection from hypoosmotic shock. The deletion of FtMscS also led to a reduced average cell size without altering gross cell morphology. The mechanosensitive channel identified and characterized in this study likely contributes to the transmission of tularemia between hosts by allowing the bacterium to survive the transition from mammalian hosts to freshwater.
IMPORTANCE The contamination of freshwater by Francisella tularensis subsp. holarctica has resulted in a number of outbreaks of tularemia. Invariably, the contamination originates from the carcasses or excreta of infected animals and thus involves an abrupt osmotic downshock as the bacteria enter freshwater. How F. tularensis survives this drastic change in osmolarity has not been clear, but here we report that a single mechanosensitive channel protects the bacterium from osmotic downshock. This channel is functional despite lacking much of the cytoplasmic vestibule domain that is present in better-studied organisms such as Escherichia coli; this report builds on previous studies that have suggested that parts of this domain are dispensable for downshock protection. These findings extend our understanding of the aquatic cycle and ecological persistence of F. tularensis, with further implications for mechanosensitive channel biology.},

  volume = {180},
  issn = {0021-9193 (Print) 0021-9193 (Linking)},
  abstract = {RpoS, the stationary-phase sigma factor of Escherichia coli, is responsible for increased transcription of an array of genes when cells enter stationary phase and under certain stress conditions. RpoS is rapidly degraded during exponential phase and much more slowly during stationary phase; the resulting changes in RpoS accumulation play an important role in providing differential expression of RpoS-dependent gene expression. It has previously been shown that rapid degradation of RpoS during exponential growth depends on RssB (also called SprE and MviA), a protein with homology to the family of response regulators, and on the ClpXP protease. We find that RssB regulation of proteolysis does not extend to another ClpXP substrate, bacteriophage lambda O protein, suggesting that RssB acts on the specific substrate RpoS rather than on the protease. In addition, the activity of RpoS is down-regulated by RssB when degradation is blocked. In cells blocked for RpoS degradation by a mutation in clpP, cells devoid of RssB show a four- to fivefold-higher activity of an RpoS-dependent reporter fusion than cells overproducing RssB. Therefore, RssB allows specific environmental regulation of RpoS accumulation and may also modulate activity. The regulation of degradation provides an irreversible switch, while the regulation of activity may provide a second, presumably reversible level of control.},

  abstract = {Recombineering allows DNA cloned in Escherichia coli to be modified via lambda (lambda) Red-mediated homologous recombination, obviating the need for restriction enzymes and DNA ligases to modify DNA. Here, we describe the construction of three new recombineering strains (SW102, SW105 and SW106) that allow bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) to be modified using galK positive/negative selection. This two-step selection procedure allows DNA to be modified without introducing an unwanted selectable marker at the modification site. All three strains contain an otherwise complete galactose operon, except for a precise deletion of the galK gene, and a defective temperature-sensitive lambda prophage that makes recombineering possible. SW105 and SW106 cells in addition carry l-arabinose-inducible Cre or Flp genes, respectively. The galK function can be selected both for and against. This feature greatly reduces the background seen in other negative-selection schemes, and galK selection is considerably more efficient than other related selection methods published. We also show how galK selection can be used to rapidly introduce point mutations, deletions and loxP sites into BAC DNA and thus facilitate functional studies of SNP and/or disease-causing point mutations, the identification of long-range regulatory elements and the construction of conditional targeting vectors.},

  abstract = {Cellular membranes are a heterogeneous mix of lipids, proteins and small molecules. Special groupings enriched in saturated lipids and cholesterol form liquid-ordered domains, known as "lipid rafts," thought to serve as platforms for signaling, trafficking and material transport throughout the secretory pathway. Questions remain as to how the cell maintains small fluid lipid domains, through time, on a length scale consistent with the fact that no large-scale phase separation is observed. Motivated by these examples, we have utilized a combination of mechanical modeling and in vitro experiments to show that membrane morphology plays a key role in maintaining small domain sizes and organizing domains in a model membrane. We demonstrate that lipid domains can adopt a flat or dimpled morphology, where the latter facilitates a repulsive interaction that slows coalescence and helps regulate domain size and tends to laterally organize domains in the membrane.},

The energetics of deformation allow two membrane proteins in close proximity to influence each other's equilibrium conformation via their local deformations, and spatially organize the proteins based on their geometry. We use the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) as a case study to examine the implications of bilayer-mediated elastic interactions on protein conformational statistics and clustering. The deformations around MscL cost energy on the order of 10 kBT and extend approximately 3 nm from the protein edge, as such elastic forces induce cooperative gating, and we propose experiments to measure these effects. Additionally, since elastic interactions are coupled to protein conformation, we find that conformational changes can severely alter the average separation between two proteins. This has important implications for how conformational changes organize membrane proteins into functional groups within membranes.},

We provide an experimental approach and theoretical framework for measuring the mechanical properties of live bacteria. We encapsulated bacteria in agarose with a user-defined stiffness, measured the growth rate of individual cells and fit data to a thin-shell mechanical model to extract the effective longitudinal Young's modulus of the cell envelope of Escherichia coli (50-150 MPa), Bacillus subtilis (100-200 MPa) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (100-200 MPa). Our data provide estimates of cell wall stiffness similar to values obtained via the more labour-intensive technique of atomic force microscopy. To address physiological perturbations that produce changes in cellular mechanical properties, we tested the effect of A22-induced MreB depolymerization on the stiffness of E. coli. The effective longitudinal Young's modulus was not significantly affected by A22 treatment at short time scales, supporting a model in which the interactions between MreB and the cell wall persist on the same time scale as growth. Our technique therefore enables the rapid determination of how changes in genotype and biochemistry affect the mechanical properties of the bacterial envelope.},

  abstract = {Gene expression is a stochastic, or "noisy," process. This noise comes about in two ways. The inherent stochasticity of biochemical processes such as transcription and translation generates "intrinsic" noise. In addition, fluctuations in the amounts or states of other cellular components lead indirectly to variation in the expression of a particular gene and thus represent "extrinsic" noise. Here, we show how the total variation in the level of expression of a given gene can be decomposed into its intrinsic and extrinsic components. We demonstrate theoretically that simultaneous measurement of two identical genes per cell enables discrimination of these two types of noise. Analytic expressions for intrinsic noise are given for a model that involves all the major steps in transcription and translation. These expressions give the sensitivity to various parameters, quantify the deviation from Poisson statistics, and provide a way of fitting experiment. Transcription dominates the intrinsic noise when the average number of proteins made per mRNA transcript is greater than approximately 2. Below this number, translational effects also become important. Gene replication and cell division, included in the model, cause protein numbers to tend to a limit cycle. We calculate a general form for the extrinsic noise and illustrate it with the particular case of a single fluctuating extrinsic variable-a repressor protein, which acts on the gene of interest. All results are confirmed by stochastic simulation using plausible parameters for Escherichia coli.},

We found that almost all protein number distributions can be described by the gamma distribution with two fitting parameters which, at low expression levels, have clear physical interpretations as the transcription rate and protein burst size. At high expression levels, the distributions are dominated by extrinsic noise. We found that a single cell's protein and mRNA copy numbers for any given gene are uncorrelated.},

  issn = {0026-8925 (Print) 0026-8925 (Linking)},
  abstract = {The nucleotide sequence of the 5' upstream region of the Escherichia coli rpoS gene was determined and analyzed. At least four promoters responsible for rpoS transcription were identified, and designated P1, P2, P3 and P4, P1 being furthest from the upstream. Using lacZ fusion genes, the P2 promoter was found to be the strongest of the four. All of these promoters are regulated similarly, and their activity is enhanced 2 to 3-fold in stationary phase. P1 and P2 transcription start sites were determined by primer extension analyses. The P2 promoter region shows similarity to the consensus sigma 70-type promoter sequence, and was recognized by both E sigma 70 and E sigma 38 holoenzymes in vitro. The mRNA transcribed from the most distal promoter, P1, appears to include another open reading frame (orf-281), indicating that the two open reading frames comprise an operon. The rpoS gene product (sigma 38) was rapidly degraded after addition of chloramphenicol to cultures in the exponential, but not the stationary phase. This strongly suggests that posttranslational regulation is involved in the control of rpoS expression.},

  volume = {113},
  issn = {0022-1295 (Print) 0022-1295 (Linking)},
  abstract = {MscL is multimeric protein that forms a large conductance mechanosensitive channel in the inner membrane of Escherichia coli. Since MscL is gated by tension transmitted through the lipid bilayer, we have been able to measure its gating parameters as a function of absolute tension. Using purified MscL reconstituted in liposomes, we recorded single channel currents and varied the pressure gradient (P) to vary the tension (T). The tension was calculated from P and the radius of curvature was obtained using video microscopy of the patch. The probability of being open (Po) has a steep sigmoidal dependence on T, with a midpoint (T1/2) of 11.8 dyn/cm. The maximal slope sensitivity of Po/Pc was 0.63 dyn/cm per e-fold. Assuming a Boltzmann distribution, the energy difference between the closed and fully open states in the unstressed membrane was DeltaE = 18.6 kBT. If the mechanosensitivity arises from tension acting on a change of in-plane area (DeltaA), the free energy, TDeltaA, would correspond to DeltaA = 6.5 nm2. MscL is not a binary channel, but has four conducting states and a closed state. Most transition rates are independent of tension, but the rate-limiting step to opening is the transition between the closed state and the lowest conductance substate. This transition thus involves the greatest DeltaA. When summed over all transitions, the in-plane area change from closed to fully open was 6 nm2, agreeing with the value obtained in the two-state analysis. Assuming a cylindrical channel, the dimensions of the (fully open) pore were comparable to DeltaA. Thus, the tension dependence of channel gating is primarily one of increasing the external channel area to accommodate the pore of the smallest conducting state. The higher conducting states appear to involve conformational changes internal to the channel that don't involve changes in area.},

  abstract = {Mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs) which could provide for fast osmoregulatory responses in bacteria, remain unidentified as molecular entities. MSCs from Escherichia coli (strain AW740) were examined using the patch-clamp technique, either (a) in giant spheroplasts, (b) after reconstitution by fusing native membrane vesicles with asolectin liposomes, or (c) by reassembly of octylglucoside-solubilized membrane extract into asolectin liposomes. MSC activities were similar in all three preparations, consisting of a large nonselective MSC of 3-nS conductance (in 200 mM KCl) that was activated by high negative pressures, and a small weakly anion-selective MSC of 1 nS activated by lower negative pressures. Both channels appeared more sensitive to suction in liposomes than in spheroplasts. After gel filtration of the solubilized membrane extract and reconstituting the fractions, both large MSC and small MSC activities were retrieved in liposomes. The positions of the peaks of channel activity in the column eluate, assayed by patch sampling of individual fractions reconstituted in liposomes, showed an apparent molecular mass under nondenaturing conditions of about 60-80 kDa for the large and 200-400 kDa for the small MSC. We conclude that (a) the large MSC and the small MSC are distinct molecular entities, (b) the fact that both MSCs were functional in liposomes following chromatography strongly suggests that these channels are gated by tension transduced via lipid bilayer, and (c) chromatographic fractionation of detergent-solubilized membrane proteins with subsequent patch sampling of reconstituted fractions can be used to identify and isolate these MS channel proteins.},

Here we have solubilized and fractionated the envelope, reconstituted the MscL activity in vitro, and traced it to a small protein, whose gene, mscL, we then cloned. Insertional disruption of mscL removes the channel activity, whereas re-expression of mscL borne on an expression plasmid restores it. MscL-channel activities were observed in material from a cell-free expression system with mscL as the only template. The mscL nucleotide sequence predicts a unique protein of only 136 amino acids, with a highly hydrophobic core and very different from porins or other known proteins.},

  volume = {185},
  issn = {0021-9193 (Print) 0021-9193 (Linking)},
  abstract = {Escherichia coli strain MG1655 was chosen for sequencing because the few mutations it carries (ilvG rfb-50 rph-1) were considered innocuous. However, it has a number of growth defects. Internal pyrimidine starvation due to polarity of the rph-1 allele on pyrE was problematic in continuous culture. Moreover, the isolate of MG1655 obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center also carries a large deletion around the fnr (fumarate-nitrate respiration) regulatory gene. Although studies on DNA microarrays revealed apparent cross-regulation of gene expression between galactose and lactose metabolism in the Stock Center isolate of MG1655, this was due to the occurrence of mutations that increased lacY expression and suppressed slow growth on galactose. The explanation for apparent cross-regulation between galactose and N-acetylglucosamine metabolism was similar. By contrast, cross-regulation between lactose and maltose metabolism appeared to be due to generation of internal maltosaccharides in lactose-grown cells and may be physiologically significant. Lactose is of restricted distribution: it is normally found together with maltosaccharides, which are starch degradation products, in the mammalian intestine. Strains designated MG1655 and obtained from other sources differed from the Stock Center isolate and each other in several respects. We confirmed that use of other E. coli strains with MG1655-based DNA microarrays works well, and hence these arrays can be used to study any strain of interest. The responses to nitrogen limitation of two urinary tract isolates and an intestinal commensal strain isolated recently from humans were remarkably similar to those of MG1655.},

The different characteristics of green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimeras in a cell can be studied by FRAP, in which a selected region of the cell is photobleached with intense light. The movement of unbleached molecules into a photobleached region is quantified by imaging with an attenuated light source. The movement of molecules between cellular compartments can be determined by FLIP, in which the same region of a cell expressing a GFP chimera is repeatedly photobleached. The loss of fluorescence from regions outside the photobleached region is monitored to characterize the movement of a protein. Together these two techniques are providing fundamentally new insights into the kinetic properties of proteins in cells.},

Reduced levels of MS proteins and reduced expression of mscL- and mscS-LacZ fusions in an rpoS mutant strain suggested that the RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing sigmaS is responsible, at least in part, for regulating production of MS channel proteins. Consistent with the model that the effect of sigmaS is direct, the MscS and MscL promoters both use RNA polymerase containing sigmaS in vitro. Conversely, clpP or rssB mutations, which cause enhanced levels of sigmaS, show increased MS channel protein synthesis. RpoS null mutants are sensitive to hypoosmotic shock upon entry into stationary phase. These data suggest that MscS and MscL are components of the RpoS regulon and play an important role in ensuring structural integrity in stationary phase bacteria.},

  abstract = {Yeasts are often exposed to variations in osmotic pressure in their natural environments or in their substrates when used in fermentation industries. Such changes may lead to cell death or activity loss. Although the involvement of the plasma membrane is strongly suspected, the mechanism remains unclear. Here, the integrity and functionality of the yeast plasma membrane at different levels of dehydration and rehydration during an osmotic treatment were assessed using various fluorescent dyes. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy of cells stained with oxonol, propidium iodide, and lucifer yellow were used to study changes in membrane polarization, permeabilization, and endocytosis, respectively. Cell volume contraction, reversible depolarization, permeabilization, and endovesicle formation were successively observed with increasing levels of osmotic pressure during dehydration. The maximum survival rate was also detected at a specific rehydration level, of 20 MPa, above which cells were strongly permeabilized. Thus, we show that the two steps of an osmotic treatment, dehydration and rehydration, are both involved in the induction of cell death. Permeabilization of the plasma membranes is the critical event related to cell death. It may result from lipidic phase transitions in the membrane and from variations in the area-to-volume ratio during the osmotic treatment.},

Bacteriophage homologous recombination proteins catalyze these recombineering reactions using double- and single-stranded linear DNA substrates, so-called targeting constructs, introduced by electroporation. Gene knockouts, deletions and point mutations are readily made, gene tags can be inserted and regions of bacterial artificial chromosomes or the E. coli genome can be subcloned by gene retrieval using recombineering.

  abstract = {Bacteria respond to osmotic stress by a substantial increase in the intracellular osmolality, adjusting their cell turgor for altered growth conditions. Using Escherichia coli as a model organism we demonstrate here that bacterial responses to hyperosmotic stress specifically depend on the nature of osmoticum used. We show that increasing acute hyperosmotic NaCl stress above approximately 1.0 Os kg(-1) causes a dose-dependent K(+) leak from the cell, resulting in a substantial decrease in cytosolic K(+) content and a concurrent accumulation of Na(+) in the cell. At the same time, isotonic sucrose or mannitol treatment (non-ionic osmotica) results in a gradual increase of the net K(+) uptake. Ion flux data are consistent with growth experiments showing that bacterial growth is impaired by NaCl at the concentration resulting in a switch from net K(+) uptake to efflux. Microarray experiments reveal that about 40\% of upregulated genes shared no similarity in their responses to NaCl and sucrose treatment, further suggesting specificity of osmotic adjustment in E. coli to ionic and non-ionic osmotica. The observed differences are explained by the specificity of the stress-induced changes in the membrane potential of bacterial cells highlighting the importance of voltage-gated K(+) transporters for bacterial adaptation to hyperosmotic stress.},

  abstract = {In Escherichia coli, starvation (stationary-phase)-mediated differentiation involves 50 or more genes and is triggered by an increase in cellular sigma s levels. Western immunoblot analysis showed that in mutants lacking the protease ClpP or its cognate ATPase-containing subunit ClpX, sigma s levels of exponential-phase cells increased to those of stationary-phase wild-type cells. Lack of other potential partners of ClpP, i.e., ClpA or ClpB, or of Lon protease had no effect. In ClpXP-proficient cells, the stability of sigma s increased markedly in stationary-phase compared with exponential-phase cells, but in ClpP-deficient cells, sigma s became virtually completely stable in both phases. There was no decrease in ClpXP levels in stationary-phase wild-type cells. Thus, sigma s probably becomes more resistant to this protease in stationary phase. The reported sigma s-stabilizing effect of the hns mutation also was not due to decreased protease levels. Studies with translational fusions containing different lengths of sigma s coding region suggest that amino acid residues 173 to 188 of this sigma factor may directly or indirectly serve as at least part of the target for ClpXP protease.},

Although it is one of the most fundamental processes of life, the entire cascade has never been quantified on a genome-wide scale. Here we simultaneously measured absolute mRNA and protein abundance and turnover by parallel metabolic pulse labelling for more than 5,000 genes in mammalian cells. Whereas mRNA and protein levels correlated better than previously thought, corresponding half-lives showed no correlation. Using a quantitative model we have obtained the first genome-scale prediction of synthesis rates of mRNAs and proteins. We find that the cellular abundance of proteins is predominantly controlled at the level of translation. Genes with similar combinations of mRNA and protein stability shared functional properties, indicating that half-lives evolved under energetic and dynamic constraints. Quantitative information about all stages of gene expression provides a rich resource and helps to provide a greater understanding of the underlying design principles.},

  abstract = {We describe a mechanosensitive (MS) channel that has mechanosensitive channel of miniconductance (MscM) activity, and displays unique properties with respect to gating. Mechanosensitive channels respond to membrane tension, are ubiquitous from bacteria to man, and exhibit a great diversity in structure and function. These channels protect Bacteria and Archaea against hypoosmotic shock and are critical determinants of shape in chloroplasts. Given the dominant roles played in bacteria by the mechanosensitive channel of small conductance (MscS) and the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL), the role of the multiple MS channel homologs observed in most organisms remains obscure. Here we demonstrate that a MscS homolog, YbdG, extends the range of hypoosmotic shock that Escherichia coli cells can survive, but its expression level is insufficient to protect against severe shocks. Overexpression of the YbdG protein provides complete protection. Transcription and translation of the ybdG gene are enhanced by osmotic stress consistent with a role for the protein in survival of hypoosmotic shock. Measurement of the conductance of the native channel by standard patch clamp methods was not possible. However, a fully functional YbdG mutant channel, V229A, exhibits a conductance in membrane patches consistent with MscM activity. We find that MscM activities arise from more than one gene product because ybdG deletion mutants still exhibit an occasional MscM-like conductance. We propose that ybdG encodes a low-abundance MscM-type MS channel, which in cells relieves low levels of membrane tension, obviating the need to activate the major MS channels, MscS and MscL.},

These quantitative experiments call for a corresponding modeling effort that addresses the question of how changes in promoter architecture affect variability in gene expression in a systematic rather than case-by-case fashion. In this article we make such a systematic investigation, based on a microscopic model of gene regulation that incorporates stochastic effects. In particular, we show how operator strength and operator multiplicity affect this variability. We examine different modes of transcription factor binding to complex promoters (cooperative, independent, simultaneous) and how each of these affects the level of variability in transcriptional output from cell-to-cell. We propose that direct comparison between in vivo single-cell experiments and theoretical predictions for the moments of the probability distribution of mRNA number per cell can be used to test kinetic models of gene regulation. The emphasis of the discussion is on prokaryotic gene regulation, but our analysis can be extended to eukaryotic cells as well.},

An important characteristic of these systems is the rise-time: the delay from the initiation of production until half maximal product concentration is reached. Here we employ synthetic gene circuits in Escherichia coli to measure the rise-times of non-self-regulated and of negatively autoregulated transcription units. Non-self-regulated units have a rise-time of one cell-cycle. We demonstrate experimentally that negative autoregulation feedback (also termed autogenous control) reduces the rise-time to about one fifth of a cell-cycle. This agrees with an analytical solution of a mathematical model for negative autoregulation. This may help in understanding the function of negative autoregulation, which appears in over 40\% of known transcription factors in E.coli.},

Here we show that this relation, which we call the gene regulation function (GRF), fluctuates dynamically in individual living cells, thereby limiting the accuracy with which transcriptional genetic circuits can transfer signals. Using fluorescent reporter genes and fusion proteins, we characterized the bacteriophage lambda promoter P(R) in Escherichia coli. A novel technique based on binomial errors in protein partitioning enabled calibration of in vivo biochemical parameters in molecular units. We found that protein production rates fluctuate over a time scale of about one cell cycle, while intrinsic noise decays rapidly. Thus, biochemical parameters, noise, and slowly varying cellular states together determine the effective single-cell GRF. These results can form a basis for quantitative modeling of natural gene circuits and for design of synthetic ones.},

Furthermore, the method can simultaneously track particles of all different sizes, and allows significant freedom in their shape. The algorithm is evaluated using the quantitative measures of accuracy and precision of previous authors, using simulated images at variable signal-to-noise ratios. To these we add new tests: the error due to a non-uniform background, and the error due to two particles approaching each other. Finally the tracking of particles in real cell images is demonstrated.

  abstract = {Degradation of the general stress sigma factor sigmaS of Escherichia coli is a prime example of regulated proteolysis in prokaryotes. Whereas exponentially growing cells rapidly degrade sigmaS, various stress conditions result in stabilization and, therefore, rapid accumulation of sigmaS. Proteolysis of sigmaS requires the response regulator RssB, a direct recognition factor with phosphorylation-dependent affinity for sigmaS, which targets sigmaS to the ClpXP protease. Here, we demonstrate that a sudden increase in sigmaS synthesis results in sigmaS stabilization, indicating titration of an essential proteolytic component. Evidence is provided that RssB is the overall rate-limiting factor for sigmaS proteolysis. As a consequence, the cell has to continuously adjust the expression of RssB to sigmaS in order to maintain sigmaS proteolysis in growing cells, despite variations in the rate of sigmaS synthesis. Such homeostatic feedback-coupling is provided by rssB transcription being dependent on the sigmaS-controlled rssAB operon promoter. However, strong and rapid increases in sigmaS synthesis, in re-sponse to acute stress, exceed the compensatory potential of this feedback loop with the result that sigmaS is stabilized because of RssB titration. We propose that RssB control of sigmaS proteolysis functions as a genetic switch, in which (i) the 'off' state (low sigmaS levels caused by proteolysis) is stabilized by a homeostatic negative feedback, and (ii) the threshold for switching to the 'on' state (high levels of stable sigmaS) is dependent on the cellular level of active, i.e. phosphorylated RssB.},

  abstract = {Trp fluorescence spectroscopy is a powerful tool to study the structures of membrane proteins and their interactions with the surrounding lipid bilayer. Many membrane proteins contain more than one Trp residue, making analysis of the fluorescence data more complex. The mechanosensitive channels MscL's of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TbMscL) and Escherichia coli (EcMscL) contain no Trp residues. We have therefore introduced single Trp residues into the transmembrane regions of TbMscL and EcMscL to give the Trp-containing mutants F80W-TbMscL and F93W-EcMscL, respectively, which we show are highly suitable for measurements of lipid binding constants. In vivo cell viability assays in E. coli show that introduction of the Trp residues does not block function of the channels. The Trp-containing mutants have been reconstituted into lipid bilayers by mixing in cholate followed by dilution to re-form membranes. Cross-linking experiments suggest that the proteins retain their pentameric structures in phosphatidylcholines with chain lengths between C14 and C24, phosphatidylserines, and phosphatidic acid. Quenching of Trp fluorescence by brominated phospholipids suggests that the Trp residue in F80W-TbMscL is more exposed to the lipid bilayer than the Trp residue in F93W-EcMscL. Binding constants for phosphatidylcholines change with changing fatty acyl chain length, the strongest interaction for both TbMscL and EcMscL being observed with a chain of length C16, corresponding to a bilayer of hydrophobic thickness ca. 24 A, compared to a hydrophobic thickness for TbMscL of about 26 A estimated from the crystal structure. Lipid binding constants change by only a factor of 1.5 in the chain length range from C12 to C24, much less than expected from theories of hydrophobic mismatch in which the protein is treated as a rigid body. It is concluded that MscL distorts to match changes in bilayer thickness. The binding constants for dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine for both TbMscL and EcMscL relative to those for dioleoylphosphatidylcholine are close to 1. Quenching experiments suggest a single class of binding sites for phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, and cardiolipin on TbMscL; binding constants are greater than those for phosphatidylcholine and decrease with increasing ionic strength, suggesting that charge interactions are important in binding these anionic phospholipids. Quenching experiments suggest two classes of lipid binding sites on TbMscL for phosphatidic acid, binding of phosphatidic acid being much less dependent on ionic strength than binding of phosphatidylserine.},

  abstract = {The effect of the kinetics of water potential variation (psi) on the viability of bacteria subjected to hyperosmotic stresses in water-glycerol solution was studied. The three bacteria used were Lactobacillus plantarum L-73, Leuconostoc mesenteroides LM057 and Escherichia coli TG1. These strains were submitted to a final water potential of -107.2 MPa, -170.9 MPa and/or -244.7 MPa. In any case the kinetics of water potential variation was found to have a great effect on the cell viability. The application of slow water potential decreases could maintain an important cell viability (about 80-100\%) with regard to the corresponding viability observed after a sudden step change for the same final water potential (15-57\%). For each strain tested, an optimal dehydration kinetics was determined which depended on the final water potential. The existence of this optimum could be explained thanks to the opposition of two actions affecting cell viability: a positive action relative to the slowness of the water potential variation and a negative action relative to the residence time of cells in a critical range of water potential.},

  abstract = {Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus plantarum were subjected to final water potentials of -5.6 MPa and -11.5 MPa with three solutes: glycerol, sorbitol and NaCl. The water potential decrease was realized either rapidly (osmotic shock) or slowly (20 min) and a difference in cell viability between these conditions was only observed when the solute was NaCl. The cell mortality during osmotic shocks induced by NaCl cannot be explained by a critical volume decrease or by the intensity of the water flow across the cell membrane. When the osmotic stress is realized with NaCl as the solute, in a medium in which osmoregulation cannot take place, the application of a slow decrease in water potential resulted in the significant maintenance of cell viability (about 70-90\%) with regard to the corresponding viability observed after a sudden step change to same final water potential (14-40\%). This viability difference can be explained by the existence of a critical internal free Na+ concentration.},

  title = {Two Families of Mechanosensitive Channel Proteins},
  volume = {67},
  issn = {1092-2172 (Print) 1092-2172 (Linking)},
  abstract = {Mechanosensitive (MS) channels that provide protection against hypoosmotic shock are found in the membranes of organisms from the three domains of life: bacteria, archaea, and eucarya. Two families of ubiquitous MS channels are recognized, and these have been designated the MscL and MscS families. A high-resolution X-ray crystallographic structure is available for a member of the MscL family, and extensive molecular genetic, biophysical, and biochemical studies conducted in many laboratories have allowed postulation of a gating mechanism allowing the interconversion of a tightly closed state and an open state that controls transmembrane ion and metabolite fluxes. In contrast to the MscL channel proteins, which are of uniform topology, the much larger MscS family includes protein members with topologies that are predicted to vary from 3 to 11 alpha-helical transmembrane segments (TMSs) per polypeptide chain. Sequence analyses reveal that the three C-terminal TMSs of MscS channel proteins are conserved among family members and that the third of these three TMSs exhibits a 20-residue motif that is shared by the channel-forming TMS (TMS 1) of the MscL proteins. We propose that this C-terminal TMS in MscS family homologues serves as the channel-forming helix in a homooligomeric structure. The presence of a conserved residue pattern for the putative channel-forming TMSs in the MscL and MscS family proteins suggests a common structural organization, gating mechanism, and evolutionary origin.},

CrCAX1 was more closely related to fungal cation exchanger (CAX) genes than those from higher plants but has structural characteristics similar to plant Ca2+/H+ exchangers including a long N-terminal tail. When CrCAX1-GFP was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it localized at the vacuole. CrCAX1 could suppress the Ca2+-hypersensitive phenotype of a yeast mutant and mediated proton gradient-dependent Ca2+/H+ exchange activity in vacuolar membrane vesicles. Ca2+ transport activity was increased following N-terminal truncation of CrCAX1, suggesting the existence of an N-terminal auto-regulatory mechanism. CrCAX1 could also provide tolerance to Na+ stress when expressed in yeast or Arabidopsis thaliana because of Na+/H+ exchange activity. This Na+/H+ exchange activity was not regulated by the N terminus of the CrCAX1 protein. A subtle tolerance by CrCAX1 in yeast to Co2+ stress was also observed. CrCAX1 was transcriptionally regulated in Chlamydomonas cells grown in elevated Ca2+ or Na+. This study has thus uncovered a novel eukaryotic proton-coupled transporter, CrCAX1, that can transport both monovalent and divalent cations and that appears to play a role in cellular cation homeostasis by the transport of Ca2+ and Na+ into the vacuole.},

But biochemical events do not necessarily occur in single steps of individual molecules. Some processes are greatly randomized when synthesis or degradation occurs in large bursts of many molecules during a short time interval. Conversely, each birth or death of a macromolecule could involve several small steps, creating a memory between individual events. We present a generalized theory for stochastic gene expression, formulating the variance in protein abundance in terms of the randomness of the individual gene expression events. We show that common types of molecular mechanisms can produce gestation and senescence periods that reduce noise without requiring higher abundances, shorter lifetimes, or any concentration-dependent control loops. We also show that most single-cell experimental methods cannot distinguish between qualitatively different stochastic principles, although this in turn makes such methods better suited for identifying which components introduce fluctuations. Characterizing the random events that give rise to noise in concentrations instead requires dynamic measurements with single-molecule resolution.},

  volume = {66},
  issn = {0099-2240 (Print) 0099-2240 (Linking)},
  abstract = {The relationship between membrane damage and loss of viability following pressure treatment was examined in Escherichia coli strains C9490, H1071, and NCTC 8003. These strains showed high, medium, and low resistance to pressure, respectively, in stationary phase but similar resistance to pressure in exponential phase. Loss of membrane integrity was measured as loss of osmotic responsiveness or as increased uptake of the fluorescent dye propidium iodide. In exponential-phase cells, loss of viability was correlated with a permanent loss of membrane integrity in all strains, whereas in stationary-phase cells, a more complicated picture emerged in which cell membranes became leaky during pressure treatment but resealed to a greater or lesser extent following decompression. Strain H1071 displayed a very unusual pressure response in stationary phase in which survival decreased to a minimum at 300 MPa but then increased at 400 to 500 MPa before decreasing again. Membranes were unable to reseal after treatment at 300 MPa but could do so after treatment at higher pressures. Membrane damage in this strain was thus typical of exponential-phase cells under low-pressure conditions but of stationary-phase cells under higher-pressure conditions. Heat shock treatment of strain H1071 cells increased pressure resistance under low-pressure conditions and also allowed membrane damage to reseal. Growth in the presence of IPTG (isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside) increased resistance under high-pressure conditions. The mechanisms of inactivation may thus differ at high and low pressures. These studies support the view that membrane damage is an important event in the inactivation of bacteria by high pressure, but the nature of membrane damage and its relation to cell death may differ between species and phases of growth.},

By creating a gene fusion between mscl and the gene encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) we were able to express the fusion protein MscL-GFP in bacteria. We show that MscL-GFP is present in the cytoplasmic membrane and forms functional channels. These channels have the same characteristics as wild-type MscL, except that they require more pressure to open.

When rehydration occurred quickly from an hyperosmotic level of 133 MPa in glycerol solution before slow rehydration by plating on an agar surface to reach initial osmotic pressure (1.4 MPa), bacterial viability was strongly related to the intensity of the hypo-osmotic gradient used. Rehydration to 107 MPa resulted in a survival ratio of 41\%, whereas strong rehydration to 1.4 MPa resulted in only 0.7\% survival. These studies also demonstrated the influence of the rehydration kinetic on cell recovery.

  issn = {0014-2956 (Print) 0014-2956 (Linking)},
  abstract = {Escherichia coli like most gram-negative bacteria with walls maintains a cytoplasmic osmolarity exceeding that of the medium; the resulting hydrostatic pressure (turgor pressure) pushes the cytoplasmic membrane against the peptidoglycan and creates a tension in the two envelopes. Potassium is the only cation which takes part in the regulation of cellular osmolarity. The adaptation of intracellular K+ concentration to external osmolarity involves K+ turgor-controlled fluxes. When the medium osmolarity is raised an osmodependent influx of K+ can be observed; this is carried out by the K+ transport system TrkA which can also taken up rubidium. A specific and unidirectional pathway allows K+ ions to flow out of the cell when the medium osmolarity is decreased; this pathway reveals two characteristics: it has no affinity for rubidium and it can be blocked by the blockers of eukaryotic K+ channels. Osmodependent fluxes are turned on immediately after the medium osmolarity is disturbed; in contrast, they are turned off gradually as the rate of K+ fluxes approach zero. The rate of K+ influx seems to depend on the level of internal osmolarity and not on the extent of the increase in medium osmolarity. The rate of the efflux is directly proportional to the decrease in medium osmolarity and is independent on the level of internal osmolarity.},

The mechanosensitive channel of small conductance (MscS) is perhaps the most intensively studied of these channels. MscS has at least two states: closed, which does not allow solutes to exit the cytoplasm, and open, which allows rapid efflux of solvent and solutes. The ability to appropriately open or close the channel (gating) is critical to bacterial survival. We briefly review the science that led to the isolation and identification of MscS. We concentrate on the structure-function relationship of the channel, in particular the structural and biochemical approaches to understanding channel gating. We highlight the troubling discrepancies between the various models developed to understand MscS gating.},

  abstract = {Levels of RpoS increase upon glucose starvation in Escherichia coli, which leads to the transcription of genes whose products combat a variety of stresses. RpoS stability is a key level of control in this process, as SprE (RssB)-mediated degradation is inhibited under glucose starvation. Starvation for ammonia or phosphate also results in increased stress resistance and induction of RpoS-dependent genes. However, we demonstrate that RpoS levels following ammonia starvation are only slightly increased compared to growing cells and are 10-fold below the levels observed under glucose or phosphate limitation. This difference is largely due to regulated proteolysis of RpoS, as its stability in ammonia-starved cells is intermediate between that in logarithmic-phase cells and glucose-starved cells. Use of an rpoS construct that is devoid of the gene's native transcriptional and translational control regions reveals that stability differences are sufficient to explain the different levels of RpoS observed in logarithmic phase, ammonia starvation, and glucose starvation. Under phosphate starvation, however, rpoS translation is increased. The cellular response to nutrient limitation is much more complex than previously appreciated, as there is not simply one response that is activated by starvation for any essential nutrient. Our data support the hypothesis that SprE activity is the key level at which ammonia and glucose starvation signals are transmitted to RpoS, and they suggest that carbon source and/or energy limitation are necessary for full inactivation of the SprE pathway.},

However, important research directions, particularly those involving mathematical modelling and simulation of biological processes, also critically depend on absolutely quantitative data--that is, knowledge of the concentration of the expressed proteins as a function of cellular state. Until now, absolute protein concentration measurements of a considerable fraction of the proteome (73\%) have only been derived from genetically altered Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, a technique that is not directly portable from yeast to other species. Here we present a mass-spectrometry-based strategy to determine the absolute quantity, that is, the average number of protein copies per cell in a cell population, for a large fraction of the proteome in genetically unperturbed cells. Applying the technology to the human pathogen Leptospira interrogans, a spirochete responsible for leptospirosis, we generated an absolute protein abundance scale for 83\% of the mass-spectrometry-detectable proteome, from cells at different states. Taking advantage of the unique cellular dimensions of L. interrogans, we used cryo-electron tomography morphological measurements to verify, at the single-cell level, the average absolute abundance values of selected proteins determined by mass spectrometry on a population of cells. Because the strategy is relatively fast and applicable to any cell type, we expect that it will become a cornerstone of quantitative biology and systems biology.},

APEX relies upon correcting each protein's mass spectrometry sampling depth (observed peptide count) by learned probabilities for identifying the peptides. APEX abundances agree with measurements from controls, western blotting, flow cytometry and two-dimensional gels, as well as known correlations with mRNA abundances and codon bias, providing absolute protein concentrations across approximately three to four orders of magnitude. Using APEX, we demonstrate that 73\% of the variance in yeast protein abundance (47\% in E. coli) is explained by mRNA abundance, with the number of proteins per mRNA log-normally distributed about approximately 5,600 ( approximately 540 in E. coli) protein molecules/mRNA. Therefore, levels of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins are set per mRNA molecule and independently of overall protein concentration, with $>$70\% of yeast gene expression regulation occurring through mRNA-directed mechanisms.},

  abstract = {The ability of cells to sense and respond to mechanical force underlies diverse processes such as touch and hearing in animals, gravitropism in plants, and bacterial osmoregulation. In bacteria, mechanosensation is mediated by the mechanosensitive channels of large (MscL), small (MscS), potassium-dependent (MscK) and mini (MscM) conductances. These channels act as 'emergency relief valves' protecting bacteria from lysis upon acute osmotic down-shock. Among them, MscL has been intensively studied since the original identification and characterization 15 years ago. MscL is reversibly and directly gated by changes in membrane tension. In the open state, MscL forms a non-selective 3 nS conductance channel which gates at tensions close to the lytic limit of the bacterial membrane. An earlier crystal structure at 3.5 A resolution of a pentameric MscL from Mycobacterium tuberculosis represents a closed-state or non-conducting conformation. MscL has a complex gating behaviour; it exhibits several intermediates between the closed and open states, including one putative non-conductive expanded state and at least three sub-conducting states. Although our understanding of the closed and open states of MscL has been increasing, little is known about the structures of the intermediate states despite their importance in elucidating the complete gating process of MscL. Here we present the crystal structure of a carboxy-terminal truncation mutant (Delta95-120) of MscL from Staphylococcus aureus (SaMscL(CDelta26)) at 3.8 A resolution. Notably, SaMscL(CDelta26) forms a tetrameric channel with both transmembrane helices tilted away from the membrane normal at angles close to that inferred for the open state, probably corresponding to a non-conductive but partially expanded intermediate state.},

  abstract = {By exploring global gene expression of Escherichia coli growing on six different carbon sources, we discovered a striking genome transcription pattern: as carbon substrate quality declines, cells systematically increase the number of genes expressed. Gene induction occurs in a hierarchical manner and includes many factors for uptake and metabolism of better but currently unavailable carbon sources. Concomitantly, cells also increase their motility. Thus, as the growth potential of the environment decreases, cells appear to devote progressively more energy on the mere possibility of improving conditions. This adaptation is not what would be predicated by classic regulatory models alone. We also observe an inverse correlation between gene activation and rRNA synthesis suggesting that reapportioning RNA polymerase (RNAP) contributes to the expanded genome activation. Significant differences in RNAP distribution in vivo, monitored using an RNAP-green fluorescent protein fusion, from energy-rich and energy-poor carbon source cultures support this hypothesis. Together, these findings represent the integration of both substrate-specific and global regulatory systems, and may be a bacterial approximation to metazoan risk-prone foraging behavior.},

The channel determined by KefA does not appear to have a major role in managing the transition from high to low osmolarity. In contrast, analysis of mutants of E.coli lacking YggB and MscL shows that mechanosensitive channels are designed to open at a pressure change just below that which would cause cell disruption leading to death.},

  abstract = {The second vegetative sigma factor sigma S (encoded by the rpoS gene) is the master regulator in a complex regulatory network that governs the expression of many stationary phase-induced and osmotically regulated genes in Escherichia coli. Using a combination of gene-fusion technology and quantitative immunoblot, pulse-labeling, and immunoprecipitation analyses, we demonstrate here that rpoS/sigma S expression is not only transcriptionally controlled, but is also extensively regulated at the levels of translation and protein stability. rpoS transcription is inversely correlated with growth rate and is negatively controlled by cAMP-CRP. In complex medium rpoS transcription is stimulated during entry into stationary phase, whereas in minimal media, it is not significantly induced. rpoS translation is stimulated during transition into stationary phase as well as by an increase in medium osmolarity. A model involving mRNA secondary structure is suggested for this novel type of post-transcriptional growth phase-dependent and osmotic regulation. Furthermore, sigma S is a highly unstable protein in exponentially growing cells (with a half-life of 1.4 min), that is stabilized at the onset of starvation. When cells are grown in minimal glucose medium, translational induction and sigma S stabilization occur in a temporal order with the former being stimulated already in late exponential phase and the latter taking place at the onset of starvation. Although sigma S does not control its own transcription, it is apparently indirectly involved in a negative feedback control that operates on the post-transcriptional level. Our analysis also indicates that at least five different signals [cAMP, a growth rate-related signal (ppGpp?), a cell density signal, an osmotic signal, and a starvation signal] are involved in the control of all these processes that regulate rpoS/sigma S expression.},

  abstract = {In growing Escherichia coli cells, the master regulator of the general stress response, sigmaS (RpoS), is subject to rapid proteolysis. In response to stresses such as sudden carbon starvation, osmotic upshift or shift to acidic pH, sigmaS degradation is inhibited, sigmaS accumulates and numerous sigmaS-dependent genes with stress-protective functions are activated. sigmaS proteolysis is dependent on ClpXP protease and the response regulator RssB, whose phosphorylated form binds directly to sigmaS in vitro. Here, we show that substitutions of aspartate 58 (D58) in RssB, which result in higher sigmaS levels in vivo, produce RssB variants unable to bind sigmaS in vitro. Thus, RssB is the direct substrate recognition factor in sigmaS proteolysis, whose affinity for sigmaS depends on phosphorylation of its D58 residue. RssB does not dimerize or oligomerize upon this phosphorylation and sigmaS binding, and RssB and sigmaS exhibit a 1:1 stoichiometry in the complex. The receiver as well as the output domain of RssB are required for sigmaS binding (as shown in vivo and in vitro) and for complementation of an rssB null mutation. Thus, the N-terminal receiver domain plays an active and positive role in RssB function. Finally, we demonstrate that RssB is not co-degraded with sigmaS, i.e. RssB has a catalytic role in the initiation of sigmaS turnover. A model is presented that integrates the details of RssB-sigmaS interaction, the RssB catalytic cycle and potential stress signal input in the control of sigmaS proteolysis.},

This is particularly pertinent in cancer biology because downregulation of tumour metastasis suppressor genes is a common occurrence, and the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well established. Here we report that the downregulation of a metastasis suppressor gene, KAI1, in prostate cancer cells involves the inhibitory actions of beta-catenin, along with a reptin chromatin remodelling complex. This inhibitory function of beta-catenin-reptin requires both increased beta-catenin expression and recruitment of histone deacetylase activity. The coordinated actions of beta-catenin-reptin components that mediate the repressive state serve to antagonize a Tip60 coactivator complex that is required for activation; the balance of these opposing complexes controls the expression of KAI1 and metastatic potential. The molecular mechanisms underlying the antagonistic regulation of beta-catenin-reptin and the Tip60 coactivator complexes for the metastasis suppressor gene, KAI1, are likely to be prototypic of a selective downregulation strategy for many genes, including a subset of NF-kappaB target genes.},

Using quantitative microfluorometry, neutrophil-mediated extracellular pulses of reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs) and pericellular proteolysis were periodically observed showing that these functions occur as quantal bursts. However, chronic granulomatous disease neutrophils, which do not produce ROMs, did not display ROM deposition. Matrices show an alternating pattern of green (proteolytic) and red (oxidative) fluorescence, indicating these functions are out of phase. Electric fields phase-matched with metabolic oscillations, which increase the amplitude of intracellular NAD(P)H oscillations, increase ROM deposition and pericellular proteolysis; this further supports the link between intracellular chemical oscillators and extracellular functions. This phase relationship may allow ROMs to inactivate protease inhibitors, followed by protease activation.},

  abstract = {The mechanosensitive channel of small conductance (MscS) is a bacterial tension-driven osmolyte release valve with homologues in many walled eukaryotic organisms. When stimulated by steps of tension in excised patches, Escherichia coli MscS exhibits transient opening followed by reversible adaptation and then complete inactivation. Here, we study properties of the inactivation transition, which renders MscS nonconductive and tension insensitive. Using special pressure protocols we demonstrate that adaptation and inactivation are sequential processes with opposite tension dependencies. In contrast to many eukaryotic channels, which inactivate from the open state, MscS inactivates primarily from the closed state because full openings by preconditioning pulses do not influence the degree of inactivation, and saturating tensions keeping channels open prevent inactivation. The easily opened A98S mutant lacks inactivation completely, whereas the L111S mutant with a right-shifted activation curve inactivates silently before reaching the threshold for opening. This suggests that opening and inactivation are two independent tension-driven pathways, both starting from the closed state. Analysis of tension dependencies for inactivation and recovery rates estimated the in-plane expansion (DeltaA) associated with inactivation as 8.5 nm(2), which is about half of the area change for opening. Given that the interhelical contact between the outer TM1-TM2 pairs and the core TM3s is the force-transmitting path from the periphery to the gate, the determined DeltaA now can be used as a constraining parameter for the models of the inactivated state in which the lipid-facing TM1-TM2 pairs are displaced and uncoupled from the gate.},

Although many molecular details of the composition and assembly of cell-wall components are known, how the network of peptidoglycan subunits is organized to give the cell shape during normal growth and how it is reorganized in response to damage or environmental forces have been relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce a quantitative physical model of the bacterial cell wall that predicts the mechanical response of cell shape to peptidoglycan damage and perturbation in the rod-shaped Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. To test these predictions, we use time-lapse imaging experiments to show that damage often manifests as a bulge on the sidewall, coupled to large-scale bending of the cylindrical cell wall around the bulge. Our physical model also suggests a surprising robustness of cell shape to peptidoglycan defects, helping explain the observed porosity of the cell wall and the ability of cells to grow and maintain their shape even under conditions that limit peptide crosslinking. Finally, we show that many common bacterial cell shapes can be realized within the same model via simple spatial patterning of peptidoglycan defects, suggesting that minor patterning changes could underlie the great diversity of shapes observed in the bacterial kingdom.},

  abstract = {The sigma(S) (RpoS) subunit of RNA polymerase is the master regulator of the general stress response in Escherichia coli and related bacteria. While rapidly growing cells contain very little sigma(S), exposure to many different stress conditions results in rapid and strong sigma(S) induction. Consequently, transcription of numerous sigma(S)-dependent genes is activated, many of which encode gene products with stress-protective functions. Multiple signal integration in the control of the cellular sigma(S) level is achieved by rpoS transcriptional and translational control as well as by regulated sigma(S) proteolysis, with various stress conditions differentially affecting these levels of sigma(S) control. Thus, a reduced growth rate results in increased rpoS transcription whereas high osmolarity, low temperature, acidic pH, and some late-log-phase signals stimulate the translation of already present rpoS mRNA. In addition, carbon starvation, high osmolarity, acidic pH, and high temperature result in stabilization of sigma(S), which, under nonstress conditions, is degraded with a half-life of one to several minutes. Important cis-regulatory determinants as well as trans-acting regulatory factors involved at all levels of sigma(S) regulation have been identified. rpoS translation is controlled by several proteins (Hfq and HU) and small regulatory RNAs that probably affect the secondary structure of rpoS mRNA. For sigma(S) proteolysis, the response regulator RssB is essential. RssB is a specific direct sigma(S) recognition factor, whose affinity for sigma(S) is modulated by phosphorylation of its receiver domain. RssB delivers sigma(S) to the ClpXP protease, where sigma(S) is unfolded and completely degraded. This review summarizes our current knowledge about the molecular functions and interactions of these components and tries to establish a framework for further research on the mode of multiple signal input into this complex regulatory system.},

Recent data suggest that sigma factor specificity at stress-activated promoters is affected by the interplay of the two RNA polymeraseholoenzymes with additional regulatory factors, such as H-NS, Lrp, CRP, IHF or Fis, that differentially affect transcription initiation by sigmaS or sigma70 in a promoter-specific manner.},

Creation and analysis of synthetic networks, composed of well-characterized genetic elements, provide a framework for theoretical modeling. Here, with the use of a combinatorial method, a library of networks with varying connectivity was generated in Escherichia coli. These networks were composed of genes encoding the transcriptional regulators LacI, TetR, and lambda CI, as well as the corresponding promoters. They displayed phenotypic behaviors resembling binary logical circuits, with two chemical "inputs" and a fluorescent protein "output." Within this simple system, diverse computational functions arose through changes in network connectivity. Combinatorial synthesis provides an alternative approach for studying biological networks, as well as an efficient method for producing diverse phenotypes in vivo.},

  abstract = {The general stress sigma factor RpoS (sigma s) is induced during entry into stationary phase and in response to multiple stress conditions. RpoS is regulated at the levels of transcription, translation, proteolysis and protein activity. A key factor in RpoS control is the two-component response regulator RssB, which acts as a direct recognition and targeting factor for ClpXP-mediated RpoS proteolysis. A major, but not the only phosphodonor for RssB is the complex histidine sensor kinase ArcB. ArcB coordinates RpoS proteolysis with rpoS transcription by also phosphorylating the response regulator ArcA, which besides controlling a large regulon, also acts as a transcriptional repressor for rpoS. ArcB activity depends on the redox state of the respiratory chain, which links RpoS control to the balance between energy supply and available respiratory electron acceptor. In addition, the BarA/UvrY and Rcs phosphorelay systems can activate rpoS transcription and translation, respectively. These systems are involved in the control of motility, biofilm formation and/or virulence, suggesting that further studying a potential role of RpoS in these physiological functions may be rewarding.},

Transformation of these constructs into an E. coli strain carrying an inducible T7 RNA polymerase gene allowed the specific production and labelling of MscL with [35S]methionine. Preparation of membrane fractions of E. coli cells by sucrose gradient centrifugation indicated that the radiolabelled MscL was present in the inner cytoplasmic membrane in agreement with results of several studies. However, treatment of the labelled cells and cell membrane vesicles with various cross-linkers resulted in the majority of labelled protein migrating as a monomer with a small proportion of molecules (approximately 25\%) migrating as dimers and higher order multimers. This result is in contrast with a finding of a study suggesting that the channel exclusively forms hexamers in the cell membrane of E. coli (1) and therefore may have profound implication for the activation and/or "multimerization" of the channel by mechanical stress exerted to the membrane. In addition, from the specific activity of the radiolabelled protein and the amount of protein in the cytoplasmic membrane fraction we estimated the number of MscL ion channels expressed under these conditions to be approximately 50 channels per single bacterium.},

  abstract = {Mechanosensitive channels allow bacteria to respond to osmotic stress by opening a nanometer-sized pore in the cellular membrane. Although the underlying mechanism has been thoroughly studied on the basis of individual channels, the behavior of channel ensembles has yet to be elucidated. This work reveals that mechanosensitive channels of large conductance (MscL) exhibit a tendency to spatially cluster, and demonstrates the functional relevance of clustering. We evaluated the spatial distribution of channels in a lipid bilayer using patch-clamp electrophysiology, fluorescence and atomic force microscopy, and neutron scattering and reflection techniques, coupled with mathematical modeling of the mechanics of a membrane crowded with proteins. The results indicate that MscL forms clusters under a wide range of conditions. MscL is closely packed within each cluster but is still active and mechanosensitive. However, the channel activity is modulated by the presence of neighboring proteins, indicating membrane-mediated protein-protein interactions. Collectively, these results suggest that MscL self-assembly into channel clusters plays an osmoregulatory functional role in the membrane.},

  abstract = {Protein levels have been shown to vary substantially between individual cells in clonal populations. In prokaryotes, the contribution to such fluctuations from the inherent randomness of gene expression has largely been attributed to having just a few transcripts of the corresponding mRNAs. By contrast, eukaryotic studies tend to emphasize chromatin remodeling and burst-like transcription. Here, we study single-cell transcription in Escherichia coli by measuring mRNA levels in individual living cells. The results directly demonstrate transcriptional bursting, similar to that indirectly inferred for eukaryotes. We also measure mRNA partitioning at cell division and correlate mRNA and protein levels in single cells. Partitioning is approximately binomial, and mRNA-protein correlations are weaker earlier in the cell cycle, where cell division has recently randomized the relative concentrations. Our methods further extend protein-based approaches by counting the integer-valued number of transcript with single-molecule resolution. This greatly facilitates kinetic interpretations in terms of the integer-valued random processes that produce the fluctuations.},

To that end, we present a general theory of allosteric transcriptional regulation using the Monod-WymanChangeux model. We rigorously test this model using the ubiquitous simple repression motif in bacteria by first predicting the behavior of strains that span a large range of repressor copy numbers and DNA binding strengths and then constructing and measuring their response. Our model not only accurately captures the induction profiles of these strains, but also enables us to derive analytic expressions for key properties such as the dynamic range and [EC50]. Finally, we derive an expression for the free energy of allosteric repressors that enables us to collapse our experimental data onto a single master curve that captures the diverse phenomenology of the induction profiles.},

  abstract = {The major structural features of the Escherichia coli MscS mechanosensitive channel protein have been explored using alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) fusions, precise deletions and site-directed mutations. PhoA protein fusion data, combined with the positive-inside rule, strongly support a model in which MscS crosses the membrane three times, adopting an N(out)-C(in) configuration. Deletion data suggest that the C-terminal domain of the protein is essential for the stability of the MscS channel, whereas the protein will tolerate small deletions at the N-terminus. Four mutants that exhibit either gain-of-function (GOF) or loss-of-function have been identified: a double mutation I48D/S49P inactivates MscS, whereas the MscS mutants T93R, A102P and L109S cause a strong GOF phenotype. The similarity of MscS to the last two domains of MscK (formerly KefA) is reinforced by the demonstration that expression of a truncated MscK protein can substitute for MscL and MscS in downshock survival assays. The data derived from studies of the organization, conservation and the influence of mutations provide significant insights into the structure of the MscS channel.},

Using logistic regression model, predicted mortality rate (PMR) function was calculated, and used to establish TBI severities. We determined a BOP of 145 kPa as upper mild TBI threshold (5\% PMR). Also we determined 146\textendash{}220 kPa and 221\textendash{}290 kPa levels as moderate and severe TBI based on 35\%, and 70\% PMR, respectively, while BOP above 290 kPa is lethal. Since there are no standards for animal bTBI injury severity, these thresholds need further refinements using histopathology, immunohistochemistry and behavior. Further, we specifically investigated mild TBI range (0\textendash{}145 kPa) using physiological (heart rate), pathological (lung injury), immuno-histochemical (oxidative/nitrosative and blood-brain barrier markers) as well as blood borne biomarkers. With these additional data, we conclude that mild bTBI occurs in rats when the BOP is in the range of 85\textendash{}145 kPa.},

  abstract = {We compare discriminative and generative learning as typified by logistic regression and naive Bayes. We show, contrary to a widelyheld belief that discriminative classifiers are almost always to be preferred, that there can often be two distinct regimes of performance as the training set size is increased, one in which each algorithm does better. This stems from the observation- which is borne out in repeated experiments- that while discriminative learning has lower asymptotic error, a generative classifier may also approach its (higher) asymptotic error much faster.},

  abstract = {Multilabel classification is an extension of conventional classification in which a single instance can be associated with multiple labels. Recent research has shown that, just like for conventional classification, instance-based learning algorithms relying on the nearest neighbor estimation principle can be used quite successfully in this context. However, since hitherto existing algorithms do not take correlations and interdependencies between labels into account, their potential has not yet been fully exploited. In this paper, we propose a new approach to multilabel classification, which is based on a framework that unifies instance-based learning and logistic regression, comprising both methods as special cases. This approach allows one to capture interdependencies between labels and, moreover, to combine model-based and similarity-based inference for multilabel classification. As will be shown by experimental studies, our approach is able to improve predictive accuracy in terms of several evaluation criteria for multilabel prediction.},

The best a cell can do is to monitor continually the state of occupation of receptors distributed over its surface. For nearly optimum performance only a small fraction of the surface need be specifically adsorbing. The probability that a molecule that has collided with the cell will find a receptor is Ns/(Ns + wa), if N receptors, each with a binding site of radius s, are evenly distributed over a cell of radius a. There is ample room for many independent systems of specific receptors. The adsorption rate for molecules of moderate size cannot be significantly enhanced by motion of the cell or by stirring of the medium by the cell. The least fractional error attainable in the determination of a concentration c is approximately (ThaD)-/2, where D is the diffusion constant of the attractant. The number of specific receptors needed to attain such precision is about a/s. Data on bacteriophage adsorption, bacterial chemotaxis, and chemotaxis in a cellular slime mold are evaluated. The chemotactic sensitivity of Escherichia coli approaches that of the cell of optimum design.},

A short-term memory required for such comparisons is provided by the adaptation system, which operates through the activity-dependent methylation of chemotaxis receptors. Previous theoretical studies have suggested that efficient navigation in gradients requires a well-defined adaptation rate, because the memory time scale needs to match the duration of straight runs made by bacteria. Here we demonstrate that the chemotaxis pathway of Escherichia coli does indeed exhibit a universal relation between the response magnitude and adaptation time which does not depend on the type of chemical ligand. Our results suggest that this alignment of adaptation rates for different ligands is achieved through cooperative interactions among chemoreceptors rather than through fine-tuning of methylation rates for individual receptors. This observation illustrates a yet-unrecognized function of receptor clustering in bacterial chemotaxis.},

The highly conserved general architecture of this pathway consists of two modules which mediate signal transduction and adaptation. The signal transduction module detects and amplifies changes in environmental conditions and rapidly transmits these signals to control bacterial swimming behavior. The adaptation module gradually resets the activity and sensitivity of the first module after initial stimulation and thereby enables the temporal comparisons necessary for bacterial chemotaxis. Recent experimental and theoretical work has unraveled multiple quantitative features emerging from the interplay between these two modules. This has laid the groundwork for rationalization of these emerging properties in the context of the evolutionary optimization of the chemotactic behavior.},

  abstract = {Bacteria navigate within inhomogeneous environments by temporally comparing concentrations of chemoeffectors over the course of a few seconds and biasing their rate of reorientations accordingly, thereby drifting towards more favorable conditions. This navigation requires a short-term memory achieved through the sequential methylations and demethylations of several specific glutamate residues on the chemotaxis receptors, which progressively adjusts the receptors' activity to track the levels of stimulation encountered by the cell with a delay. Such adaptation also tunes the receptors' sensitivity according to the background ligand concentration, enabling the cells to respond to fractional rather than absolute concentration changes, i.e. to perform logarithmic sensing. Despite the adaptation system being principally well understood, the need for a specific number of methylation sites remains relatively unclear. Here we systematically substituted the four glutamate residues of the Tar receptor of Escherichia coli by non-methylated alanine, creating a set of 16 modified receptors with a varying number of available methylation sites and explored the effect of these substitutions on the performance of the chemotaxis system. Alanine substitutions were found to desensitize the receptors, similarly but to a lesser extent than glutamate methylation, and to affect the methylation and demethylation rates of the remaining sites in a site-specific manner. Each substitution reduces the dynamic range of chemotaxis, by one order of magnitude on average. The substitution of up to two sites could be partly compensated by the adaptation system, but the full set of methylation sites was necessary to achieve efficient logarithmic sensing.},

Analyses of cheR and/or cheB mutants, defective in receptor methylation/demethylation, show that response sensitivity depends on the activity of CheB and the level of receptor modification. In cheRcheB mutants, the concentration of attractant that generates a half-maximal response is equal to the dissociation constant of the receptor. In wild-type cells, it is 35 times smaller. This amplification, together with the ultrasensitivity of the flagellar motor, explains previous observations of high chemotactic gain.},

As a first step, we investigated the molecular-level mechanisms of crystallization of this protein from high-concentration phosphate buffer in its stable carbomonoxy form using high-resolution atomic force microscopy. We found that in conditions of equilibrium with the solution, the crystals' surface reconstructs into four-molecule-wide strands along the crystallographic a (or b) axis. However, the crystals do not grow by the alignment of such preformed strands. We found that the crystals grow by the attachment of single molecules to suitable sites on the surface. These sites are located along the edges of new layers generated by two-dimensional nucleation or by screw dislocations. During growth, the steps propagate with random velocities, with the mean being an increasing function of the crystallization driving force. These results show that the crystallization mechanisms of HbC are similar to those found for other proteins. Therefore, strategies developed to control protein crystallization in vitro may be applicable to pathology-related crystallization systems.},

To determine the extent by which absolute TF concentration dictates gene expression and morphogenesis programs that ultimately lead to patterns in Drosophila embryos, we manipulate maternally supplied patterning determinants and measure readout concentration at the position of various developmental markers. When we increase the overall amount of the maternal TF Bicoid (Bcd) fivefold, Bcd concentrations in cells at positions of the cephalic furrow, an early morphological marker, differ by a factor of 2. This finding apparently contradicts the traditional threshold-dependent readout model, which predicts that the Bcd concentrations at these positions should be identical. In contrast, Bcd concentration at target gene expression boundaries is nearly unchanged early in development but adjusts dynamically toward the same twofold change as development progresses. Thus, the Drosophila segmentation gene network responds faithfully to Bcd concentration during early development, in agreement with the threshold model, but subsequently partially adapts in response to altered Bcd dosage, driving segmentation patterns toward their WT positions. This dynamic response requires other maternal regulators, such as Torso and Nanos, suggesting that integration of maternal input information is not achieved through molecular interactions at the time of readout but through the subsequent collective interplay of the network.},

  abstract = {The open channel diameter of Escherichia coli recombinant large-conductance mechanosensitive ion channels (MscL) was estimated using the model of Hille (Hille, B. 1968. Pharmacological modifications of the sodium channels of frog nerve. J. Gen. Physiol. 51:199-219) that relates the pore size to conductance. Based on the MscL conductance of 3.8 nS, and assumed pore lengths, a channel diameter of 34 to 46 A was calculated. To estimate the pore size experimentally, the effect of large organic ions on the conductance of MscL was examined. Poly-L-lysines (PLLs) with a diameter of 37 A or larger significantly reduced channel conductance, whereas spermine (approximately 15 A), PLL19 (approximately 25 A) and 1,1'-bis-(3-(1'-methyl-(4,4'-bipyridinium)-1-yl)-propyl)-4,4'-b ipyridinium (approximately 30 A) had no effect. The smaller organic ions putrescine, cadaverine, spermine, and succinate all permeated the channel. We conclude that the open pore diameter of the MscL is approximately 40 A, indicating that the MscL has one of the largest channel pores yet described. This channel diameter is consistent with the proposed homohexameric model of the MscL.},

  abstract = {Understanding how distinct parts of proteins produce coordinated behavior has driven and continues to drive advances in protein science and enzymology. However, despite consensus about the conceptual basis for allostery, the idiosyncratic nature of allosteric mechanisms resists general approaches. Computational methods can identify conformational transition states from structural changes, revealing common switching mechanisms that impose multistate behavior. Thermodynamic cycles use factorial perturbations to measure coupling energies between side chains in molecular switches that mediate shear during domain motion. Such cycles have now been complemented by modular cycles that measure energetic coupling between separable domains. For one model system, energetic coupling between domains has been shown to be quantitatively equivalent to that between dynamic side chains. Linkages between domain motion, switching residues, and catalysis make nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis conditional on domain movement, confirming an essential yet neglected aspect of free energy transduction and suggesting the potential generality of these studies.},
