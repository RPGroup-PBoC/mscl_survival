## Supplement C: Classification of Cell Fate

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We defined a survival event as a cell that went on
to divide at least twice in the several hours following the applied osmotic
shock. In nearly all of our experiments, cells which did not survive an
osmotic shock exhibited extensive necrotic death with complete loss of phase
contrast, extensive blebbing and bursting of the membrane, and loss of
structural intensity. An example field across time is shown below in
[@Fig:phase_death] where the cells exhibit necrotic death. We have also
included a supplementary video of this field (Video S1). Occasionally, we
observed cells which did not obviously display necrotic death yet did not
undergo one or two division events. These cells were not
counted in our experiments and were not included in the final tally of
survival versus death. Across our 2822 single cell measurements, such “no
call” classifications were observed only 83 times, constituting only 3% of
the total cell measurements. A breakdown of all classification types and
their respective abundances can be seen in Table S1.

Cells classified as dead are denoted by red arrows. The lone surviving cell in this field (bottom row, top ¼ of image) is marked in green.

| **Classification** | **Number of Observations** | **Percentage of Measurements**|
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Dead-On-Arrival | 11 | 0.4% |
| No Call | 83 | 3% | 
| Death | 1246 | 44% |
| Survival | 1482 | 53% |
: **Cell fate classifications and their relative abundances in the complete data set.**  “Dead-on-Arrival” classification was assigned to cells that appeared to be dead (displaying necrotic death) before application of osmotic shock. “No Call” was assigned to cells to whom fate could not be applied. “Death” was assigned to cells which displayed either obvious necrotic death or did not undergo at least two division events.  “Survival” was assigned to cells which underwent at least two division events after osmotic shock. Neither “No Call” nor “Dead-On-Arrival” classifications were included in the final analysis. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assess the validity of our morphology-based
classification scheme, we performed a subset of the osmotic shock experiments
described in the manuscript using propidium iodide staining to mark cells
which had compromised membranes, identifying them as dead. Briefly, cells
expressing on average $\sim$ 80 MscL channels per cell were grown in LB + 500
mM NaCl to an OD~600nm~ of approximately 0.25. The cells were then mounted in
the flow cell as described in the Materials and Methods in the main text and
subjected to a large osmotic shock. After the shock, the cells were monitored
for two hours. The propidium iodide stain (LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial Cell Viability Staining, Thermo Fisher)
was then passed into the flow chamber and allowed to incubate with the cells
for a short period of time. The remaining dye was then washed out with LB
Lennox medium and imaged. An example of image of the phase contrast and
propidium iodide fluorescence images are shown in [@Fig:pi_death]. We note
that cells displaying necrotic death, meaning loss of phase
contrast and visible distortion of the cell membrane, were strongly marked
with propidium iodide, confirming that these cells were dead. The
few example of “no call” classification where survival or death could not be
determined from morphology alone showed that these cells were in fact dead
(see highlighted row in [@Fig:pi_death]). Cells that went on to divide two or
more times in this period were not significantly stained with propidium
iodide, confirming their viability and effectiveness of the stain itself.
Given this data set, we compared the classification breakdown using our
morphology-based method with the conclusive results from the propidium iodide
staining (Table S2). We found that the two approaches to defining death
agreed within 1%. This agreement leads us to believe that our definition of
cell survival as morphological regularity and sustained cell growth is
sufficiently accurate to draw physiological conclusions from our experiments.

The final column corresponds to fluorescence from propidium iodide. Bright fluorescence indicates intercalation with DNA indicating cell death. Classification of survival based only from morphology  is shown as text in the final column. Highlighted row indicates a “no call” event where morphology alone could not be used to determine survival or death.
