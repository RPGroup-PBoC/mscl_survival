# Date: 20170421
# RBS Modification: sd1
# Shock Rate: 0.71Hz
# Purpose: Process shock data from 20170421
# This experiment was conducted by shocking E. coli cells in which all seven
# mechanosensitive channel genes were removed from the chromosome. A single
# copy of mscL was introduced into the chromosome with the RBS modification
# sd1. These cells were hypo-osmotically shocked by flowing LB broth
# lacking sodium chloride at a rate of 0.71Hz monitored by the presence of
# and osmo-sensitive dye. Cells were manually marked for survivorship.
# Survivors were defined as those cells which were able to undergo two division
# events after the shock had taken place.
