<p>    The principal goal of this work is to examine the contribution of a single mechanosensitive channel species to cell survival under a hypo-osmotic shock. While this procedure could be performed for any species of channel, we chose MscL as it is the most well characterized and one of the most abundant species in <em>E. coli</em>. To probe the contribution of MscL alone, we generated an <em>E. coli</em> strain in which all seven known mechanosensitive channel genes were deleted from the chromosome followed by the integration of an <em>mscL</em> gene encoding an MscL super-folder GFP (sfGFP) fusion. Chromosomal integration imposes strict control on the gene copy number compared to plasmid borne expression systems, which is important to minimize variation in channel expression across the population and provide conditions more representative of native cell physiology. Fluorescent protein fusions have frequently been used to study MscL and have been shown through electrophysiology to function identically to the native MscL protein, allowing us to confidently draw conclusions about the role this channel plays in wild-type cells from our measurements. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bialecka-fornal2012">3</a>, <a href="#ref-norman2005">18</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>    To modulate the number of MscL channels per cell, we developed a series of mutants which were designed to decrease the expression relative to wild-type. These changes involved direct alterations of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence as well as the inclusion of AT hairpins of varying length directly upstream of the start codon which influences the translation rate and hence the number of MscL proteins produced (Fig. 2A). The six Shine-Dalgarno sequences used in this work were chosen using the RBS binding site strength calculator from the Salis Laboratory at the Pennsylvania State University <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-espahborujeni2014">19</a>, <a href="#ref-salis2009">20</a>)</span>. While the designed Shine-Dalgarno sequence mutations decreased the expression relative to wild-type as intended, the distribution of expression is remarkably wide spanning an order of magnitude.</p>
<p>    To measure the number of MscL channels per cell, we determined a fluorescence calibration factor to translate arbitrary fluorescence units per cell to protein copy number. While there have been numerous techniques developed over the past decade to directly measure this calibration factor, such as quantifying single-molecule photobleaching constants or measuring the binomial partitioning of fluorescent proteins upon cell division <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bialecka-fornal2012">3</a>, <a href="#ref-elowitz2002">21</a>)</span>, we used <em>a priori</em> knowledge of the mean MscL-sfGFP expression level of a particular <em>E. coli</em> strain to estimate the average fluorescence of a single channel. In Bialecka-Fornal et al. 2012 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bialecka-fornal2012">3</a>)</span>, the authors used single-molecule photobleaching and quantitative Western blotting to probe the expression of MscL-sfGFP under a wide range of growth conditions. To compute a calibration factor, we used the strain MLG910 (<em>E. coli</em> K12 MG1655 <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>(mscL-sfGFP)) as a &quot;standard candle&quot;, highlighted in yellow in Fig. 2B. This standard candle strain was grown and imaged in identical conditions in which the MscL count was determined. The calibration factor was computed by dividing the mean total cell fluorescence by the known MscL copy number, resulting in a measure of arbitrary fluorescence units per MscL channel. Details regarding this calculation and appropriate propagation of error can be found in the Materials &amp; Methods as well as the supplemental information (<em>Standard Candle Calibration</em>).</p>
<p>    While it is seemingly trivial to use this calibration to determine the total number of channels per cell for wild-type or highly expressing strains, the calculation for the lowest expressing strains is complicated by distorted cell morphology. We observed that as the channel copy number decreases, cellular morphology becomes increasingly aberrant with filamentous, bulging, and branched cells becoming more abundant (Fig. S3A). This morphological defect has been observed when altering the abundance of several species of mechanosensitive channels, suggesting that they play an important role in general architectural stability <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bialecka-fornal2012">3</a>, <a href="#ref-bialecka-fornal2015">4</a>)</span>. As these aberrant morphologies can vary widely in size and shape, calculating the number of channels per cell becomes a more nuanced endeavor. For example, taking the total MscL copy number for these cells could skew the final calculation of survival probability as a large but severely distorted cell would be interpreted as having more channels than a smaller, wild-type shaped cell (Fig. S3B). To correct for this pathology, we computed the average expression level per unit area for each cell and multiplied this by the average cellular area of our standard candle strain which is morphologically indistinguishable from wild-type <em>E. coli</em>, allowing for the calculation of an effective channel copy number. The effect of this correction can be seen in Fig. S3C and D, which illustrate that there is no other correlation between cell area and channel expression.</p>
<p>    Our calculation of the effective channel copy number for our suite of Shine-Dalgarno mutants is shown in Fig. 2B. The expression of these strains cover nearly three orders of magnitude with the extremes ranging from approximately four channels per cell to nearly one thousand. While the means of each strain are somewhat distinct, the distributions show a large degree of overlap, making one strain nearly indistinguishable from another. This variance is a quantity that is lost in the context of bulk scale experiments but can be accounted for via single-cell methods.</p>

<p>    To measure the channel copy number of a single cell and query its survival after a hypo-osmotic shock, we used a custom-made flow cell in which osmotic shock and growth can be monitored in real time using video microscopy (Fig. 3A). The design and characterization of this device has been described in depth previously and is briefly described in the Materials &amp; Methods <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bialecka-fornal2015">4</a>)</span>. Using this device, cells were exposed to a large hypo-osmotic shock by switching between LB Miller medium containing 500mM NaCl and LB media containing no NaCl. All six Shine-Dalgarno modifications shown in Fig. 2B (excluding MLG910) were subjected to a hypo-osmotic shock at controlled rates while under observation. After the application of the osmotic shock, the cells were imaged every sixty seconds for four to six hours. Survivors were defined as cells which underwent at least two divisions post-shock. The brief experimental protocol can be seen in Fig. 3B.</p>

(B) The typical experimental procedure. Cells are loaded into a flow chamber as shown in (A) and mounted to the glass coverslip surface.

</div>
<p>    Due to the extensive overlap in expression between the different Shine-Dalgarno mutants (see Fig. 2B), computing the survival probability by treating each mutant as an individual bin obfuscates the relationship between channel abundance and survival. To more thoroughly examine this relationship, all measurements were pooled together with each cell being treated as an individual experiment. The hypo-osmotic shock applied in these experiments was varied across a range of 0.02 Hz (complete exchange in 50 s) to 2.2 Hz (complete exchange in 0.45 s). Rather than pooling this wide range of shock rates into a single data set, we chose to separate the data into “slow shock” ( &lt; 1.0 Hz) and “fast shock” (<span class="math inline">\(\geq 1.0\)</span> Hz) classes. Other groupings of shock rate were explored and are discussed in the supplemental information (<em>Shock Classification</em>). The cumulative distributions of channel copy number separated by survival are shown in Fig. 4. In these experiments, survival was never observed for a cell containing less than approximately 100 channels per cell, indicated by the red stripe in Fig. 4. This suggests that there is a minimum number of channels needed for survival on the order of 100 per cell. We also observe a slight shift in the surviving fraction of the cells towards higher effective copy number, which matches our intuition that including more mechanosensitive channels increases the survival probability.</p>

<h3 id="prediction-of-survival-probability-as-a-function-of-channel-copy-number">Prediction of survival probability as a function of channel copy number</h3>
<p>    There are several ways by which the survival probability can be calculated. The most obvious approach would be to group each individual Shine-Dalgarno mutant as a single bin and compute the average MscL copy number and the survival probability. Binning by strain is the most frequently used approach for such measurements and has provided valuable insight into the qualitative relationship of survival on other physiological factors <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bialecka-fornal2015">4</a>, <a href="#ref-vandenberg2016">8</a>)</span>. However the copy number distribution for each Shine-Dalgarno mutant (Fig. 2B) is remarkably wide and overlaps with the other strains. We argue that this coarse-grained binning negates the benefits of performing single-cell measurements as two strains with different means but overlapping quartiles would be treated as distinctly different distributions.</p>
<p>    Another approach would be to pool all data together, irrespective of the Shine-Dalgarno mutation, and bin by a defined range of channels. Depending on the width of the bin, this could allow for finer resolution of the quantitative trend, but the choice of the bin width is arbitrary with the <em>a priori</em> knowledge that is available. Drawing a narrow bin width can easily restrict the number of observed events to small numbers where the statistical precision of the survival probability is lost. On the other hand, drawing wide bins increases the precision of the estimate, but becomes further removed from a true single-cell measurement and represents a population mean, even though it may be a smaller population than binning by the Shine-Dalgarno sequence alone. In both of these approaches, it is difficult to extrapolate the quantitative trend outside of the experimentally observed region of channel copy number. Here, we present a method to estimate the probability of survival for any channel copy number, even those that lie outside of the experimentally queried range.</p>
<p>    To quantify the survival probability while maintaining single-cell resolution, we chose to use a logistic regression model which does not require grouping data into arbitrary bins and treats each cell measurement as an independent experiment. Logistic regression is an inferential method to model the probability of a boolean or categorical event (such as survival or death) given one or several predictor variables and is commonly used in medical statistics to compute survival rates and dose response curves <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-anderson2003">22</a>, <a href="#ref-mishra2016">23</a>)</span>. The primary assumption of logistic regression is that the log-odds probability of survival <span class="math inline">\(p_{s}\)</span> is linearly dependent on the predictor variable, in our case the log channels per cell <span class="math inline">\(N_{c}\)</span> with a dimensionless intercept <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> and slope <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>, <span id="eq:linear_channel_logit"><span class="math display">\[
\log{p_s \over 1 - p_s} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \log N_c.
\qquad(1)\]</span></span> Under this assumption of linearity, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> is the log-odds probability of survival with no MscL channels. The slope <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> represents the change in the log-odds probability of survival conveyed by a single channel. As the calculated number of channels in this work spans nearly three orders of magnitude, it is better to perform this regression on <span class="math inline">\(\log N_c\)</span> as regressing on <span class="math inline">\(N_c\)</span> directly would give undue weight for lower channel copy numbers due to the sparse sampling of high-copy number cells. The functional form shown in Eq. 1 can be derived directly from Bayes’ theorem and is shown in the supplemental information (<em>Logistic Regression</em>). If one knows the values of <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>, the survival probability can be expressed as <span id="eq:prob"><span class="math display">\[
p_s = \frac{1}{1 + N_c^{-\beta_1}e^{-\beta_0}}.
\qquad(2)\]</span></span> In this analysis, we used Bayesian inferential methods to determine the most likely values of the coefficients and is described in detail in the supplemental information (<em>Logistic Regression</em>).</p>
<p>     The results of the logistic regression are shown in Fig. 5. We see a slight rightward shift the survival probability curve under fast shock relative to the slow shock case, reaffirming the conclusion that survival is also dependent on the rate of osmotic shock <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bialecka-fornal2015">4</a>)</span>. This rate dependence has been observed for cells expressing MscL alongside other species of mechanosensitive channels, but not for MscL alone. This suggests that MscL responds differently to different rates of shock, highlighting the need for further study of rate dependence and the coordination between different species of mechanosensitive channels. Fig. 5 also shows that several hundred channels are required to provide appreciable protection from osmotic shock. For a survival probability of 80%, a cell must have approximately 500 to 700 channels per cell for a fast and slow shock, respectively. The results from the logistic regression are showed as continuous colored curves. The individual cell measurements separated by survival and death are shown at the top and bottom of each plot, respectively, and are included to provide a sense of sampling density.</p>
<p>    Over the explored range of MscL copy number, we observed a maximum of 80% survival for any binning method. The remaining 20% survival may be attained when the other species of mechanosensitive channels are expressed alongside MscL. However, it is possible that the flow cell method performed in this work lowers the maximal survival fraction as the cells are exposed to several, albeit minor, mechanical stresses such as loading into the flow cell and chemical adherence to the glass surface. To ensure that the results from logistic regression accurately describe the data, we can compare the survival probabilities to those using the binning methods described earlier (red and black points, Fig. 5). Nearly all binned data fall within error of the prediction (see Materials &amp; Methods for definition of error bar on probability), suggesting that this approach accurately reflects the survival probability and gives license to extrapolate the estimation of survival probability to regions of outside of our experimentally explored copy number regime.</p>
<p>    Thus far, we’ve dictated that for a given rate of osmotic shock (i.e. &quot;fast&quot; or &quot;slow&quot;), the survival probability is dependent only on the number of channels. In Fig. S7, we show the result of including other predictor variables, such as area and shock rate alone. In such cases, including other predictors resulted in pathological curves showing that channel copy number is the most informative out of the available predictor variables.</p>
